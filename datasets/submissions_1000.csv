p6uck,We need to set some goals!,t3_p6uck,"Hey everyone,

This reddit seems like a really neat idea. But if everyone is going to be investing together, before anyone starts discussing specific purchases, we should come to some sort of consensus on how the asset allocation between investment classes in model portfolio should look. (value vs. growth investment.)

Another way to do this would be to have individuals or groups splitting off and devising their own portfolios and competing sort of like a fantasy sports pool, only with investments.

* IACI is sharply growing earnings. It made $.83 in FY2010, is expected to book $2.12 in FY2011 and analysts have it pegged for 2.60 in EPS in FY2012.

p6ll4,I Like Norfolk Southern And Request You Take a Look,t3_p6ll4,"I would suggest looking into Norfolk Southern as a high dividend paying stock. They consistantly pay a higher dividend and weathered the 2008 crisis by focusing on their core business, transportation of materials. While business did slow they are coming back to their 2006 levels. It's true they are dependent on the economy being strong for their major business but their long-term debt load is spread over a 100 year period. They have a capital structure which allows them to have significantly more Assets and Cash than debt. (Their Net Working Capital is above 1, a very good sign).  

Their Asset Turnover is very low so they make the most of their train-cars. Plus they are now double stacking them and working on improving the velocity of trains.

So for a very long term hold, and a strategy play where they own most of the railroad shipping lines on the East coast they aren't a bad play. Remember, this is a long term play. So if you read the news and see OMFGBBQ COAL SHIPMENTS DOWN, you shouldn't panic.

Anyway, please have a look Norfolk Southern (NSC)

p8tvw,Honda Motors (HMC) - Risk &amp; Reward,t3_p8tvw,"First, the basics:

* Honda Motors - Japan ADR (HMC)
* Price: $35.68 , Market Cap:	64.31B
* Price to Book (mrq): 1.14 -&gt; Equity is not returning much market value
* Articles to support case below

First off, Honda Motors is in the pits.  They've had a horrible 2 years.  Operating profit keeps dropping and signs are grim as the earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand have really devastated the supply chain.  Not to mention that the YEN to DOLLAR ratio is an absolute killer for this company right now.

It seems all gloom and doom however, this is Honda Motors we're talking about.  They have a ton of intangible assets such as technology know-how, incredible operations managers, (just look at that ROA), and a new supply chain coming online in the US and Mexico to help with risk management issues that are causing disruptions in Asia.  

External factors include:

* Wars and disruption issues in developing countries

* Unfavorable Currency fluctuations

* Interest rate risk on derivative products to limit risk to currency changes

* Environmental / Eco regulations from govts (primary Japan,US)

* Porter's 5 forces strongly in effect, competition is fierce especially with renewed entry from US Auto's and late start in China

However, Honda's culture promotes strong R&amp;D and has a name synonymous with quality in Japan and the US.  Honda will be able to maintain a strong presence in the US while they position themselves to the leading eco technology experts.

Finally, this stock is in the turnaround phase.  They see strong downside to their products and are working hard on bringing themselves back from the brink of destruction and quite epically (in my opinion).   Not a stock for the short term.   Darn, forgot to mention they pay a small dividen that's been cut to increase retained earnings in R&amp;D.

Please consider Honda for the group.

**The Key Facts**

* **What does the company do and how does it make its money**


You must fully understand what your target company does and, most importantly, how it makes its money. If you don't know where the money is coming from and why, then you may not realize that the money flow is about to decrease (or increase dramatically) until it is too late (that is, to either buy more of the stock or to sell it to profit from that projection).  

Learn how a company makes its money:

* [Yahoo! Finance ""Profile""](http://i.imgur.com/uaIH9.jpg)

* Annual Report's

* Company ""About us"" section on website






After you know the company's stock symbol and what it does to make money, you need to examine the stock itself, and understand the basic parts of a company's stock.  

[Yahoo! Finance](http://i.imgur.com/4xOq9.jpg)

**Day's price trading range**: Indicates that AAPL traded that day, at the lowest price of $453.98, to the highest price traded that day of $457.17.

**52-week price range**: In the last year, AAPL has a ""52-week low"" of $310.50, and a 52-week high price of $458.99. This ""52-week high"" is important to know, given that the most recent trading price is almost right in the middle of the 52-week range. This may assist you in determining, along with all other factors, if you believe the stock will go up or down in price from this point.

 	
**Volume today versus average daily trading volume**:  Higher volume versus the average volume traded.  Lower volume can indicate a vulnerability to more volatile movements (i.e., changes) in price. Higher volumes indicate less volatility usually, and is typically a safer trading environment. In general, stocks with lower average volumes tend to be more risky, and sometimes more speculative, stock trades.

 	
**P/E**: The ""P/E ratio"", calculated by taking the current share price (i.e., $455.12), divided by the EPS, or earnings per share, shown below that amount (i.e., $35.14). Therefore, $35.14 goes into $455.12 12.95 times, indicating that AAPL currently, at that exact share price, has a P/E ratio of 12.95. 

**Beta**:  The ""Beta"" value for AAPL is 0.92. A number describing the relation of a stock's returns with that of the financial market as a whole. A positive beta means that the asset generally follows the market. A negative beta shows that the asset inversely follows the market.


* **What Sector &amp; Which Industry?**


Identifying the sector and industry- and understanding them - are key to knowing what competitors your stock has as influences and indicators of its own performance.

**Sector**:  Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsico (PEP) are both in the same ""Sector"" which is called, ""Consumer/Non-Cyclical"" products...

**Industry**: They are both competitors within the same subcategory of that Sector - called the ""Industry"" - which, in this case, is called:  ""Beverages (Non-Alcoholic).""


* **What Competitors?**

Consider competitors as direct influences on your stock's sales and profits, and market share; and also as important indirect key indicators of how that industry is performing overall.

It is important to understand that every business has both direct, and indirect competitors:

**Direct**: Companies that offer the exact same product or service (or very similar) that your company provides.

**Indirect**: Products or services that may be similar or in related industries, or may have a strong influence on your company's key revenue sources.

* **Knowing The Share Price History**

You must know the lows and highs of your stock's share price.  Both can tell you how far the price has gone, and can go again - either up or down - with indicated price ""resistance levels"" along the way.


If you see a major spike for AAPL you can go to their Investor Relations page on their website and try to determine what the news was that probably caused that spike in its share price.  Likewise, you can then extrapolate the effect it had on Apples's stock price/performance, as a result. You can also check SEC filings and Yahoo! Finance news for the company around a specific date.


* **Knowing Number of Shares Outstanding**

Knowing the number of shares outstanding, especially relative to competitors in the same industry, can help protect your interests against possible future dilution of your shares' value.


**Internal Factors**

* **Company Website**

A company's official website offers several key benefits:

* **Marketing Information**:  Learn about your company's products and/or services.

* **Company Structure**:  How is the company divided?  Does it have subsidiaries or divisions?  If so, what they do, on how much they represent overall sales.

* **FAQs**:  While it may seem unusual, it's always interesting to find out what the company thinks are its most ""Frequently-asked Questions.""

* **Company Leadership**: The CEO, CFO and other top Officers.


* **Annual Report (10K)**

Read and learn what you can about a company from its attractive Annual Report document, but maybe be a little skeptical. You may find that you decide not to buy a stock, based on this, or it may in fact bolster your enthusiasm to buy.  

What you may find: 

**New Marketing Campaign**

**Growth Opportunities**

**Education Commitment**: Philanthropy is always good for companies

**Topline Financial Results**

**Letter from the CEO**:  Key bullet points as a takeaway from his letter:


[Must Read](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Financial-Reports-Dummies-Epstein/dp/0470376287)

* **Conference Calls**

Listening to (or reading transcripts of) company conference calls can help you know the tone of the company, and possibly find new opportunities that are hidden beneath the surface of just its reported financial numbers.


* **What to listen for**: Listening for the clues that can make you money


* **Projections for the next quarter**:  In addition to the financial projections for earnings per share and revenue goals, is management projecting any new sources of revenue (that you can do further homework on) that may cause an upside surprise in earnings growth?  Do they discuss what they believe is the timing for these new revenue sources?  Are they experiencing accelerated earnings growth (profits growing more rapidly than they expected) in certain products or divisions?


* Key areas of growth or expansion may be extrapolated to lead you to other investing opportunities


* **The Q&amp;A**: After the speakers/presentations:  After the management presentations, the call is opened up for questions from the listening audience, which is considered by many to be the most important part of the conference call. 


* **Overall Management Tone**:  What was the management mood - upbeat or monotonous?  Did you come away thinking the management was optimistic and confident about the future, or did they underwhelm you with their tone of indifference or an acknowledgement of surrender to a poor marketplace and economy?  If you don't think this matters, you can bet that the big money managers - the ones who can 


* **Insider Buying &amp; Selling**

**Company Insiders' behavior**: buying or selling their own personal stock in the company - can tell you a lot about what they believe the future holds for the stock's earnings and growth prospects.

Insider buying, in significant amounts, should also trigger a response to dig deeper and understand why those company insiders are suddenly buying up shares for their personal positions. 


* **Dividend &amp; Yield**

Dividends are used by companies to share profits with their shareholders.  The best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over time have offered dividends to their shareholders.  Dividends, compounded over time, can have a huge impact on the performance of your stock.

* **Dividend Amount**: Payments made by a publicly-traded company to its shareholders.  It is the portion of profits that the board of trustees for a company issues through a proclamation (usually quarterly if an ongoing dividend) for each share of stock owned.  These announcements usually follow the quarterly or annual earnings report, and also announce that the dividend amount is being increased, decreased or kept at the current level.

* **Dividend Yield** - The dividend's yield is a simple calculation: Dividend amount/Current Share Price


**External Factors**


* **Analyst Ratings &amp; Expectations**


You have to know the Analysts' Estimates to understand how your stock will be judged.  You also need to know the opinion of the analysts who cover your stock - from buy recommendations to sell recommendation


* **Major Holders**


You must know who holds your company's stock, and if any one group or individual controls a high percentage of stock, thereby exposing the possibility of being vulnerable to that group or individual's specific needs or wants (which could cause dramatic shifts in the share price).

Another important point is to understand the difference between total outstanding shares that have been issued, and what's knows as ""the float"" of shares outstanding.


* **News Headlines**


Combine your knowledge and perspective for a given stock with the latest daily headlines, and you may see trends or news points that you believe will affect your stock's future share price.  Therefore, keeping up with the news can be critical to your success in a stock.

**What kinds of news?**

* **Stock, Company and Competitor, Industry, Economic**





* **Industry Events**

It is critical to know what Industry Events affect your stock.
   

* **Go to the Company Site**:  Identify Upcoming Events and Read through Archived Events to learn what has been announced in the past, and what you might expect in future industry events.

* **Google Conference Search**:  Do a general search for your industry to see if you can extend your perspective on industry conferences, not found on your company's site

I am recommending PETM due to its strong franchise, the strong bond between pet owners and their pet (which leads to strong sales at PETM), and current demographics (further details below).


At 2007, ownership of dogs and cats in households are at 37% and 32% respectively (source: http://www.avma.org/reference/marketstats/ownership.asp) which indicates the primary source of this markets growth (pet ownership) still has room for growth.


We can glean further information about pet owners from a 2001 study in Canada (www.ctv.ca/generic/WebSpecials/pdf/Paws_and_Claws.pdf). At the time of study, the annual expenditure on dogs and cats were $650 and $380 respectively and that excludes ""other expenditures"" such as grooming services. (Page 9)Those figures are sure to be much higher currently. We can also see the steady increase in annual pet expenditure in these statistics (http://americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp) Furthermore, pet ownership may rise due to changing demographics and social attitudes. As the baby-boomers retire, they are in a position to take care of a pet full time and the pet in return provides companionship (Please see page 21 for demographic statistics in the Canadian market). Pet (especially dog) ownership among the younger crowd is also growing and the market is responding. Condosminiums are now including petspas and other amenities (http://life.nationalpost.com/2012/02/03/condo-canine-spas-ill-take-the-mani-pedi-and-milkbone-package/). The pdf provides many more telling statistics such as the bond between pet owners and their pet (page 38, they are part of the family) and the percentage of shoppers who buy pet food at distributors such as PETM (page 56, although those statistics are admittedly out of date).


Operationally, PETM is very sound. Revenues and cash flows have been steadily increasing every year. Liquidity should not present a problem with a current ratio of 2. Beta is 0.75 and P/E is 22.


In the past two years, PETM has risen 107.53% versus 22.57% for the S&amp;P500 index.


Risks: 


* Further economic deterioration. PETM is dependent on consumer expenditures (on their pets) to drive revenues. Despite the strong attachment to their pets, should the economy slow down, this may delay potential purchases on pets and possibly lower consumer expenditures on pets such as delaying grooming appointments and buying fewer treats for their pets.


* In the past year, PETM has easily beat the S&amp;P500, Nasdaq and DJ indices. Price may be a little over-extended, however, its strong results do provide some justification for the price action.

pl0ko,[TSLA] Tesla Motors: 5 reasons we should vote for Tesla,t3_pl0ko,"1) Tesla will be profitable by 2013 which will give great returns to investors.

http://www.bloomberg.com/video/79124654/

Upon the successful launch of the Model S Tesla is looking at 25% profit margins which is considered very high compared to other car manufacturers.

http://www.wemotor.com/blog/2011/01/tesla-to-see-better-profit-margins-thanks-to-cheaper-batteries/

On top of that the bass Tesla built for the Model S allows them to build new cars such as the Model X SUV and get them into production very quickly.


http://lifewithtesla.com/life-with-tesla-the-documentary/

(above link is a great documentary to learn more about tesla. 41 min)




2) Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla) is a modern day Tony Stark:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk

""Elon Musk (born June 28, 1971) is an South African engineer and entrepreneur best known for co-founding PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla Motors. He is currently the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and Product Architect ofTesla Motors and Chairman of SolarCity. Musk is best known for having created the first viable production electric car of the modern era (Tesla Roadster), for designing a private successor to the Space Shuttle (F9/Dragon) and creating the world's largest Internet payment system (PayPal).





3) Most electric vehicles manufacturer's such as Toyota and Ford are using Tesla's Powertrain design in their electric vehicles:

http://www.treehugger.com/cars/toyota-rav4-ev-with-tesla-powertrain-coming-to-the-us-in-2012.html

This means that for almost every electric vehicle sold Tesla makes money even if it's not a Tesla






4) Tesla is the Apple of Autos:

http://www.earthtechling.com/2011/06/new-mit-battery-will-rock-evs-energy-storage/

With any new technology early adopters usually get punished a little bit. Buyers of the iPad 1 got burned when the iPad 2 was released and many people upgraded to the better iPad 2. This pattern repeats itself through history. But with every new generation of product the technology gets better as well as the price. With time Tesla will develop electric vehicles with much better battery life than the cars they are launching now. A 500 or 600 mile battery doesn't seem out of the question in the next 5 years.

In short Elon Musk next to Zuckerberg are probably the best CEO's to come to Silicon Valley since Steve Jobs

http://www.solarfeeds.com/analyst-calls-tesla-the-apple-of-autos-tsla-aapl/


5) Let's face it buying Green makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside:

Going green seems to be the way of the future and buying a Tesla produces 0% emissions and causes 0 harmful effects on the environment if you power your Tesla on Solar Panels.

http://www.teslamotors.com/

Update: As requested by our moderator we are new required to post reasons to sell the stock that we recommend. As I don't not think Tesla is a sell at the current moment Here is an article regarding concerns over Tesla that may be reasons to sell in the future. Also I want to thank everyone that gave an up vote and even the people who down voted but commented below.

p.s. With Tesla's close today investment club is up $0.25 per share on it's first day of trading. Also I am predicting that Tesla will rise maybe back up to $34 before this Wednesday's earnings report from Tesla. The Street has a conservative whisper target on sales of the roadster so that will be a factor if Tesla rallies or dips lower in after hours on Wednesday.

http://gigaom.com/cleantech/tesla-ipo-12-things-you-should-know-about-tesla/

Update 2: My main reason to sell Tesla would be if there was low consumer interest in the Model S or if Telsa's new manufacturing plant fails to meet the demand for the Model S and the Model X.

pmhd9,IVR,t3_pmhd9,"I nominate IVR.

Yes it's a high risk REIT, but they yield 22% and have consistently, for the past 5 consecutive quarters, have increasing net income. I think their recent price drop to $15.50 is a poor valuation and *hope* this company to at least lift back to $18 - $20 within the next half-year.

The only thing I am unsure about is if it can last with future pressures on interest rates.

I do not personally have any money invested in this stock.

**EDIT**  **WHAT DOES IVR DO?**

Well, the most simple way I can explain this is this:

As far as I know, you have two different types of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trust):
1.  Equity REIT:  They own the property and have earnings based on leasing/renting/etc.
2.  Mortgage REIT:  They take investor money and lend it to other investors who want to purchase real estate.

So in this case, IVR takes investor money to lend it to other investors who purchase mostly commercial real estate.  Their primary forms of income is:

1.  Interest from their loans.
2.  Administration fees for their services.

IVR is designed to be an income generating company.  It's not so much an asset builder as much as it is a big lender.  The more lending it does, the more interest it receives.  They borrow investor money at 3-5% interest and then lend out at 6-8%.

I will try to answer questions as best I can.  I hope this helps!

Thanks!",Lihadrix,InvestmentClub,2012-02-12 21:25:33,5,1,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/pmhd9/ivr/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/pmhd9/ivr/,True,False,,,,,,,

pmw84,"[AAPL] Apple, Inc.",t3_pmw84,"Apple makes and sells a lot of mobile devices. The stock's rise to #1 in market cap has come primarily from their fast earnings growth. They also have some cash laying around.

The good:

* Earnings growth for Apple still seems to be going strong, as just in the last quater EPS was 13.89, while their guidance was a little under 10. For the holiday quarter a year ago, their EPS was 6.43, followed by 6.4 in Q2. Last year, they made almost as much in Q2 as they did in Q1.

* Their guidance is 8.5 for this quarter, but knowing how conservative they are, it's not out of the realm of possibilities for them to hit a 1 year EPS of roughly $40. EPS has to be a little under 12 this quater for this to happen, about 30% over guidance. The stock has recently liked to hover in the low 14 P/E range. With a $40 EPS, that will put it at about $560 in the next few months.

* Apple is working to continue growth. They're focusing on expanding in China, Europe, and Brazil. Brazil has high import costs that limited the ability to sell to the locals. Together with Foxconn, they've recently opened a factory there, and the lower cost of products will attract a much greater number of buyers.

* The most expensive component in the upcoming iPad 3, the display, was likely bought and paid for quiet some time ago. This will help keep costs down and margins up. Ditto for memory.

* Once an average person knows how to use an OS of a specific smartphone or a computer, they go out of their way to not have to relearn a new system. Together with good customer satisfaction, customers stay on board.

The bad:

* Patent wars. I don't know what the likelihood is of Apple winning or losing major lawsuits to Motorola or someone else. Google must've had good reason to spend $12 billion on Motorola, so this is obviously a threat.

* Apple makes huge component purchases. If something doesn't catch on, they'd have a lot of stuff just laying around.

* Like previously mention, they're #1 in market cap. How much higher can they go? After all, it's a luxury goods company, and people will stop paying for luxury goods when things aren't going well.

ponfn,[CJES] C &amp; J Energy Services,t3_ponfn,"C &amp; J is a oil &amp; gas services company, operating primarily in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Granite Wash, and Permian Basin - all of which are large shale plays. This is not an E&amp;P company. Instead, E&amp;P companies (some of their clients are: Penn Virginia, EOG, Anadarko, EXCO, PXP, Apache, etc) contract C &amp; J for their fracking/coil tubing/pressure pump services. C &amp; J currently operates 6 fracking fleets (3 more have been ordered for 2012 - bringing the total to 9 by year end), 18 coil tubing units (6 more by end of 2012), and 30 pressure pump units (21 of which are double-pump pressure pumps). They make the vast majority of their revenue from fracking, and they just ordered their 9th fleet a few days ago. The economics of their business are as follows: they aim to make roughly $400/horsepower per month. At the end of 2012, after the 3 new fleets have been added, they will be sitting on about 300,000 horsepower. A full year of 300,000 horsepower, without operating issues, and hitting their $400/month target (which they have been doing) would equal roughly $1.4 billion (in revenue). I could go on about this company - they control their supply of machinery via their purchase of certain Total assets in 2011, they only own state-of-the-art, high-pressure-rated equipment, and focus their activities on the most technically demanding projects in the industry (long horizontal drilling lengths, multiple fracking stages, relatively high usage of chemicals/proppants, high pressures, etc), and should continue to grow into other shales and expand in the shales they currently operate in. For 8x ttm earnings, and 4-5x 2012 earnings, you're getting a fast growing company with excellent margins, no debt, plenty of cash for operations, and without a growth premium.

pwrk0,Siemens AG (ADR) BUY,t3_pwrk0,"http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ASI

I believe Siemens is a buy because.

A) Price is $98/share. About $50 below it's 52 week high.
B) It's a company that has a high cash-to-share ratio. It has 18% of cash per share, or $17.64 per share in cash &amp; cash equivs.
C) As this is a European based company, after Greece works out a deal in this next week, this stock (along with many other EU-based companies) should pop.
D) Relatively low P/E Ratio of 10.32!
E) The company does make investments worldwide and in various markets. I feel this gives the company a lot of room for expansion.

Things that worry me:
A) Europes debt. It will catch up to them sometime and hit its economy hard. With Siemens doing most of it's business in Europe, it will also take a hit. (But I feel management has plans in place for this)
B) Greeces debt deal. With riots happening on a daily basis and buildings burning down, Greece is unhappy with its current economic situation and it might have an impact on the economy right through to the stock market.
C) Investors themselves are weary of a bad market, which is reflecting on the price per share now. Investors are still worried and scared from the economic crisis of 2008.

* Abysmal financial reports compared to current evaluation. 2011 profit $10mil current market cap $9 BILLION.  Just compare their financials to Monster.com (MWW) which is currently at $10/share

* Increasing competitiveness from facebook apps (Branch Out etc.)


Personally I think that this is a prime setup for a major drop in share price, therefore I'm short about 1,000 shares.

q7qtl,[Buy] Western Union (WU),t3_q7qtl,"This is my first post to the Investment Club, so let me know if I am doing anything wrong.  

I am going to give reason to my suggestion through five ratios: ROA, ROE, profit margin, current ratio, and quick ratio. 
 
Western Unions return on assets has increased 15 percent from 2010-2011.  In addition to this, there was an increase in assets of approximately one billion.  This primarily came from the purchase of three companies: a business-to-business payment system Travelex Global Business Payments and two European Western Union Agents Finint and Angelo Costa.  The prior two in an effort to infiltrate the European market. All were cash purchases. 

Return on Equity has decreased year-to-year.  This most likely stems from an exorbitant (54%) increase in equity from 2010-2011.  This should not be much of a concern since the proceeds probably aided the purchase of the three prior companies. 

Profit margin had a large increase (21%) in FY11.  I tried to investigate this further; to my surprise I was not able to find much information except a 1% decrease in the cost of service per dollar. 

Lastly, the current ratio increased; which is to be expected since there was a large asset increase funded by debt and equity. Conversely, the quick ratio decreased primarily from a large change in cash and cash equivalents.  My guess is much of this change is attributed to the acquisitions. 

As well, WU saw an odd stock price change of 10% on February 9th.  In looking at the events of that day you will find this article: http://community.nasdaq.com/News/2012-02/western-union-selloff-is-shortterm-thinking-about-a-longterm-company.aspx?storyid=120112
Which explains that the event was triggered by an earnings report posted Feb. 7th.  It goes on to explain such a reaction was probably a skittish over reaction. 

Personally, I think we should jump on for the long-haul.  But, in a conservative manner we should sell at 19.70 -- the closing price immediately prior to the price drop. This would result in a 10% increase and will probably be realized well before year end.

qcift,"[EA] Electronic Arts [Buy]
",t3_qcift,"EA is about to pop. EA is currently trading at it's 52 week low of around $16.50 off from it's $26 high. 

For those who don't know EA (Electronic Arts) is one of the top 2 video game studios in the U.S. the other being Activision.

EA's stock has been pummeled with Zynga competition rumors and their CFO recently leaving the company for a more active role at a different video game studio. 


What Wall Street isn't taking into account is the hailstorm of hit titles EA is releasing this quarter all of which will show up in the coming quarters earnings report. 

Game Sales:

Let's start with the most anticipated video game of all time; Mass Effect 3. EA has announced that pre orders for ME3 (release date march 6th) has already blown past their expectations. The ""Game"" company announced today that they will not be able to even meet the demand for ME3 pre orders in their stores. But don't worry other retailers like ""Gamestop"" is ready for the midnight madness sales of this game. Analysts are predicting this will be the best selling video game of all time beating the records that Activision's Modern Warfare 3 set last year.

Next on the list we have former Red Sox pitcher Kurt Schillings new game released by EA ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"". KOAR was highly praised by critics and fans and said to be better than the Fable series from the same genre. This game sales are steadily rising and will be reflected in the upcoming quarter.

EA also should see improved sales from Star Wars: The Old Republic which is starting to chip away at World of Warcraft's users.

On top of game sales, EA's new online ""Origin"" gaming service may be pocket Aces for EA. Most analyst see Origin as taking off in 1 or 2 years which will set EA ahead when other game publishers are forced to scramble to copy Origin.

Financials: 

I am going to quote this recent forbes article


http://www.forbes.com/sites/ycharts/2012/02/29/remember-electronic-arts-with-zynga-looking-weak-the-old-game-maker-merits-a-look/

""Zynga’s forward PE of about 36 seems pricy given the recent news.
Compare that to Electronic Arts, publisher of Madden NFL and Tiger Woods PGA Tour for Xbox360, Playstation and on your mobile. EA’s forward PE is below 15.""
""If Zynga’s moving towards EA, why not go there straightaway? Operating margins at Zynga lag those of EA’s.""

Sell: The required sell part.

EA is a sell if their games sales fall flat. Which according to their pre orders and early reviews is a very unlikely scenario.

Bottom Line:
Ea is trading at the low of it's 52 week cycle. Now is a good time to make an entry point into EA to take a long position. Especially, with the plethora of new games, most I didn't even mention being released this quarter. EA is a buy with upward gains of about 50%.

rtu9p,"[BUY] Electronic Arts, Consumist.com's Worst Company in America",t3_rtu9p,"Scott Adam's wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal right after BP spilled oil into the Gulf. The take away of that piece is that just because you hate a company doesn't mean you can't admire it as an investor. So let me try and advocate why EA's anti-consumer policies make it an attractive investment right now for the short term (1-3 months). I predict that after the results of January - March sales are released on May 8th we sill see investors rushing back to the stock.

First I want to point out the technical details of the stock. It's been testing its current level since late February, and aside from a short jump during the Mass Effect 3 release has stayed pretty consistently just above its 52 week low of 16.05. This is a stock that was trading above $23 in December. This stock has been on a fire sale since they announced 2012 EPS Estimates below what the analysts predicted. Well I happen to think that the analysts will turn out to have been right in their original estimates. EA's latest numbers predict a 2012 EPS of .75-.90, the most comparable company to EA (ATVI) currently trades at about a P/E of 14 while the rest of the major players TTWO, THQ, even Nintendo along with EA have negative trailing EPS. So let's look at what a fair value for EA would be using their estimates and a P/E of 14. EA by those assumptions should trade between 10.5 and 13. Wow, that looks like a good case to short the stock doesn't it? 

Not so fast! EA announced beatings estimates for Q3 2011 while being pessimistic  about Q4 earnings. They have had three major releases in the last Q that I believe sold better than they anticipated. I'm talking about the Origin service, their new MMO SWTOR and Mass Effect 3 + DLC. 

The new Origin service which customers love to hate is going to help EA keep even more of the sales from its games and DLC. This is a new distribution method for them and it is unpredictable how much content will be sold through it compared to retail shops at this time. But, for every little bit that goes through it EA is keeping more of the money and it ties customers into their service insuring repeat business whether the customer wants it or not. Much in the way itunes collections prevent customers from leaving Apple I can see Origin long term being a great benefit to EA just as Steam is to Valve but that will not have a major impact on the latest quarters results, it simply hasn't had the time to do its job in a significant way yet. 


As for the other two major releases here is an article worth browsing:
http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/08/electronic-arts-reveals-new-mass-effect-3-and-star-wars-mmo-numbers/


Some take aways:

* Retail chain GameStop saw a tie ratio of 40 percent of day one customers who purchased a download code for additional content together with the game: “The tie ratio at the register is the highest in their history”, said Riccitiello.
* The 1.7 million subscribers of SWTOR have mostly burned through their free 30 days and are now paying subscribers
* At the time of the article EA had SHIPPED 3.5 million copies of Mass Effect 3 (These numbers presumably do not count digital downloads as shipped is used for physical copies only. This is a major source of controversy for sales data. NDP Group the major source for video game sales data does not yet include it in their monthly reports. The ability to buy games digitally for the Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 3 is becoming increasingly popular.)


40 perecent tie ratio to DLC? That is a major boost to their margins and as far as I can tell if true globally would be unprecedented. This information is something we couldn't have guessed at in Febuary and I suggest is not factored into estimates either at EA or by analysts covering the stock.

Mass Effect 2 sat as the most popular digital download from Impulse, Direct2Drive, and Amazon for months and Mass Effect 3 has seen much greater sales volume. ""Riccitiello admitted that while EA did ""absolutely nothing"" to market the PS3 version, the digital copy captured a double-digit percent of total sales for Mass Effect 2 on PS3. EA has not revealed a specific sales number since launch, but Riccitiello said it was ""meaningful."" Source: http://au.ps3.ign.com/articles/115/1153875p1.html Mass Efffect 3 has spent 90 days in the top 100 digital downloads on Amazon. If there weren't a massive sale on older games atm it would still be in the top 10. On impulse it sits at #5. 


We must expect that Mass Effect 3 which had greater volume by far than the previous title and with the growth in popularity of digital downloads in combination with the new Origin service and high tie ratio of DLC will have sold at larger volume and higher margin than EA or Analysts could have predicted at the time.


Here is a link to slides from the most recent EA press conference.
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ERTS/1767394933x0x551496/6162F638-C8C9-45F2-AB77-463E59F00455/ERTS_Wedbush.pdf


The key things to note are the massive increase in margin and the growth in digital sales (22%).

Digital sales of games, at least on the PC, have reached over 50% of sales in the UK and have long been over 50% in the US. And again, digital sales are not recorded as shipped games.
http://www.vg247.com/2012/03/23/digital-accounts-for-51-of-pc-sales-in-the-us-and-uk/


EA will reveal the results of January to March on May 8th. Using all this information above we can get a handle on just how far off or on the mark their assumptions may have been. I'll try and do this as conservatively as possible to make the point the company is mostly likely to see a jump in share price after earnings are reported.
Mass Effect 3 sold 3.5 million shipped copies, 381,253 of which were shipped PC games according to VGChartz. Let's use 10% digital sales for PS3 and Xbox (remember Mass Effect 2 unmarketed achieved double digit % digital sales on the PS3 so 10% is most likely a low low guess) and 50% digital sales for the PC. We'll use 25% tied dlc across the board.


EA's CFO Eric Brown estimates that digital revenue can produce a 70-80% net margin. The slides estimate an 8% net margin for 2012 for the entire company.
http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2010-09-15-ea-dlc-revnue-is-above-and-beyond-physical-sales-fifa-dlc-earned-USD30m

For 2006-2009 before the massive increase in digital distribution the average profit margin for game companies was 11% and we'll use that as the assumed profit margin for physical copies of Mass Effect 3 sold.
http://smallbusiness.chron.com/typical-profit-margins-media-companies-38012.html


Calculation: 3.5 million shipped games on all platforms * 11% net margin, 0.311 million estimated digital console sales * 70% net margin,  0.195 million estimated digital PC sales * 70% net margin, and 0.8 million DLC estimated sales at 70% net margin. Let's say they sell the games to retailers for $50 each and sell the DLC for $10 each. Some quick typing in excel gives me a net revenue of $42.560 million just for mass effect 3 to date. Ignoring my estimates on the margins I get 208.3 million in gross revenue. This doesn't even take into account Deluxe Editions of the game which have higher price and higher margin than standard editions. With 1.7 million subscribers to SWTOR thats another $25.5 million in revenue every month from subscriptions in addition to the $60 to initially buy game (no idea on their margin for the game at this point).  EA has estimated revenue of about 4 billion dollars and 8% margin for the year and ~1.45 billion in net GAAP revenue for the quarter in question. These two games alone with conservative estimates account for nearly 1/5 of estimated revenue for Q1. More so using Non-GAAP estimates of $925-975 million. Even slightly more liberal assumptions could jump revenue outside the estimated bounds by EA. For example if digital sales were higher than my number and the DLC tie ratio is closer to the 40% discussed in the article then Mass Effect could move revenue an entire 1-2% for the quarter above expectations. With the pessimism surrounding EA so strong beating estimates for a second quarter in a row could bring investors back in droves.


My Buy and Sell conditions:
I suggest buying now and selling after earnings. If earnings are bad or meet expectations the share price will most likely move towards the ""fair price"" between 10.5-13 dollars. If earnings beat expectations I set a price target back to the low 20s but would Sell at 19 dollars. A May 16 and May 19 call spread would be my preferred way to bet on EA.

EDIT: Some more thoughts. For a $19 price target and using a similar P/E ratio as ATVI (14), EA would need EPS between 1.26 (P/E = 15) and 1.41 (P/E = 13) for the year. Analyst were expecting EPS of 0.29 for the quarter in question, and EA has suggested they expect to earn between 0.10 and 0.20 per share. We would need EPS for the quarter to be 0.315 at least or at 330 million shares $105 million in profit. Our conservative estimate for net revenue for Mass Effect 3 alone was $42.560 million! EA has way more going on than just that one game ;)",z0n3,InvestmentClub,2012-04-05 00:33:45,30,18,26,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/rtu9p/buy_electronic_arts_consumistcoms_worst_company/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/rtu9p/buy_electronic_arts_consumistcoms_worst_company/,True,False,,,,,,,

svpnm,[BUY] El Paso Corp - EP,t3_svpnm,"I’m placing a buy recommendation on El Paso Corp, an energy exploration company – primarily natural gas.  

The first thing I looked at was the general trend of the [stock price](http://quotes.wsj.com/EP/interactive-chart).  From the beginning of this year it has increased over 16%.  When I ran a 7 month scan of the S&amp;P 500 EP showed the highest rations of gains:days.  That is, this stock has had the greatest number of daily gains in the whole S&amp;P. 

The large increase that happened in October was due to a management restructure. 

Now, on to the financials.  Taking a look at the past 5 years of [income statements](http://quotes.wsj.com/EP/financials/annual/income-statement), we can see steady levels of revenue (generally stays around $5B) ; looking at EBITDA we can also see steady levels and perhaps even a gradual increase.  The problem comes within net income; it has been sporadic over the past 5 years with substantial losses in 2008 and 2009.  The 2009 [10-K](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066107/000095012310019484/h69839e10vk.htm) explains these losses:

” During 2009 and 2008, we recorded non-cash full cost ceiling test charges of $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion, principally as a result of declines in commodity prices.”
“In our exploration and production business, we also expect to generate significant operating cash flow and earnings, although additional non-cash ceiling test charges could impact our earnings in the future as a result of future declines in natural gas and oil prices.”

In summary, these were non-cash expenses similar to impairments of goodwill.  Looking at the [Natural Gas Index](http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=natural-gas&amp;months=60) we can see a steep drop in August on 2008 to September of 2009, since then natural gas prices have remained relatively stable.  It seems in 2011 there was a relatively large impairment of $152 million.  

[Assets](http://quotes.wsj.com/EP/financials/annual/balance-sheet) decreased heavily in 2008 due to a sell-off of unprofitable pipelines; EP is also pretty leveraged in debt, but that’s too much to handle.  Their interest coverage in 1.82 times interest with only 64 million in off-balance sheet debt (operating leases).  

[Cash flow](http://quotes.wsj.com/EP/financials/annual/cash-flow) has been relatively stable with a general up trend.  OCF is currently at 2.101 billion.  Investing has also been increasing over the past five years.  ICF is currently -3.298 billion.  Net financing cash flow is 1.404 billion.  EP has funded their investments with approximately 66% of their own money.  

All of their [ratios](http://quotes.wsj.com/EP/financials/Ratios) look pretty good.  Positive P/E and EPS.  EP has large operating gross margins (44%), operating margins (38%), and a 3% net margin.  The ratios that scare me are their liquidity ratios.  

In the past three years this stock price has increased 24%, 56%, and 64%.  This stock should be sold when we start to see drastic declines in the stock’s price.  

Edit: [Analyst estimates](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=ep), the consensus is overweight.  ",mydoggeorge,InvestmentClub,2012-04-27 19:15:54,6,2,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/svpnm/buy_el_paso_corp_ep/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/svpnm/buy_el_paso_corp_ep/,True,False,,,,,,,

ttlog,Rising natural gas prices and coal,t3_ttlog,"Natural gas producers have spent a substantial amount of money shifting production to shale oil because of the low price of gas. Coal producers (ACI, ANR, BTU) are at all time lows because coal prices are depressed as gas has been more attractive to buyers. Gas futures have bounced on the reduction in supply (which I've benefited from with UNG). The WSJ says that coal will become competitive with gas when gas is at $2.75-$3.00 (now at ~$2.72 for June delivery and rising). For that reason, analysts say, gas will hit a ceiling around there, but I'm thinking that's not correct. Since nat gas drillers have shifted to oil, the price of gas will be tied to the relative price of oil, not coal, and even though oil prices are falling, I'm thinking that debt-laden gas producers like Chesapeake won't be in any hurry to switch production back to gas. As many power generating companies are equipped to burn both coal and natural gas, it stands to reason then that both commodities will rise in price at least until becomes less profitable to produce shale oil than gas. This would mostly benefit coal companies and ETFs that track gas prices like UNG.

Is this line of thinking correct? The market doesn't seem to agree with me.

Edit: I didn't realize that the EPA's regulations on coal have screwed things up a bit. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/05/10/coal-industry-warns-proposed-epa-rule-could-force-fourth-plants-to-close/
I'm going to do a little more research on this when I have time.

tv4zo,Feeling out a new idea for our portfolio,t3_tv4zo,"I would like to note this idea stemmed from HedgeFund_Manager's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/rnioi/short_spain_ewp/). 

I was thinking that we needed to diversify our portfolio, and what better way than to buy a stock that moves in the opposite direction as our current portfolio.   I began by weighting our portfolio based on dollar value to come up with a single best ""share price"" for each close since June 30,2010. This was the furthest I could go back since Tesla is relatively new. 

From here I wrote a program that goes to Yahoo Finance and collects all the historical data for each stock in the S&amp;P 500.  With this I was then able to calculate their betas with respect to our portfolio, giving us is a representation of how a stock moves with respect to movements of our portfolio.  

I found the three lowest betas to be [Hormel Foods](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HRL) with a beta of -.1037, [Genworth Financial](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GNW) with a beta of -.1105, and [XL Group](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=xl) with a beta of -.1088.  

These aren't buy recommendations by any means, I just wanted to get a feel for the general consensus on the validity of this process.  If this is popular I'll collect more data from the NYSE and the Nasdaq.  My code is literally the most inefficient thing I've ever seen and it takes years to pull data from the internet.

u60ug,"[Buy] Autoliv (and remove recommendation for 
PetSmart)",t3_u60ug,"Firstly, I want to remove my recommendation for investing in PetSmart which was one of the first batches of recommendations submitted to r/investmentclub  [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/pbesp/petsmart_nasdaqpetm/). I recommended PETM at around $53 and it is now trading at $63 after they posted a 9-per-cent jump in first-quarter revenue yielding a return of around 19% excluding the dividend.



I would like to recommend Autoliv. NYSE: ALV. Autoliv develops and manufactures automotive safety systems and is currently trading around $57 with a market cap of over $5 billion. It’s beta is approximately 1.9, P/E of around 9, PEG of around 1.5, D/E of around 0.2. Furthermore, another great stat is ALV’s dividend yield is 3.30% with a payout ratio of 31%.



[Company website](http://www.autoliv.com/wps/wcm/connect/autoliv/Home)

[Yahoo finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=ALV+Key+Statistics)



ALV’s net sales are around 33% each in Asia, Europe and America providing a good geographic diversification. I expect sales in Asia to rise due to the increased urbanization, flat growth in America as they continue to muddle through after the great financial crisis, and a decline in Europe due to the Eurozone woes which I believe is a structural problem that won’t be fixed.

Another reason to love ALV is its research and innovation driven culture. Its products are without a doubt an incredibly important part of the automotive industry which will not be going away anytime soon. ALV accounted for around 8% of all new automotive safety patents in 2009 and holds more than 6,300 patents.



Their products which include seat-belts, airbags and more advanced technology are sold to a diversified mix of customers (essentially all of the big automotive brands that you have heard of including GM, Ford, BMW, Toyota, Mazda, etc.)



In summary, I believe an investment in ALV is a solid play on a company that provides a vital product. It’ll fluctuate around in the short term to the state of the global automotive industry, but its strong product line and dividend should make it a good candidate for a long term investment.",bgritzut,InvestmentClub,2012-05-26 15:03:13,9,12,13,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/u60ug/buy_autoliv_and_remove_recommendation_for_petsmart/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/u60ug/buy_autoliv_and_remove_recommendation_for_petsmart/,True,False,,,,,,,
ucxb8,[Buy] CenturyLink,t3_ucxb8,"[CenturyLink’s](http://quotes.wsj.com/CTL/financials/annual/income-statement) general consensus:

* [A Leading Telecom Dividend Stock](http://seekingalpha.com/article/624141-centurylink-a-leading-telecom-dividend-stock) - SeekingAlpha.

* [Nomura Reiterates Buy on CenturyLink]( http://www.dailypolitical.com/finance/stock-market/nomura-reiterates-buy-on-centurylink-ctl.htm) – Daily Political 

It looks like this stock is a huge play for its dividends.  They have consistently been paying out $2.90 for the past couple years (comes in quarterly installments of .725), and it looks like the stock price is riding a nice upward trend.  And as it should; in 2011 CenturyLink bought Savvis and Qwest.   For those curious, [Savvis]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savvis) is a company that specializes in cloud computing and [Qwest]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwest), an internet data provider.  

Skimming their [10-K](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000104746912001666/a2207599z10-k.htm) brings up some interesting points. 

The acquisitions added $23.8 billion in assets and $20.1 billion in liabilities.  If these companies were to have been bought on Jan 1 operating revenue would have been 21% higher and net income 5% higher.  Expenses would have been 22% higher and EPS 9% lower. 

Broadband subscribers went from 2,349 thousand in 2010 to 5,554 thousand in 2011, a 136% change; access lines went from 6,489 thousand in 2010 ton 14,584 thousand in 2011, a 124% change.  Regional market income increased 55%; business market income increased 670%; and wholesale markets increased 108%. 
Net income was down 39%, but that’s attributed to Qwest/Savvis’ interest and depreciation expenses.  There was also a large, undisclosed expense for acquisition integration.  Operating cash flow increased by 105% and EBITDA increased 47%.

This company is gathering a lot of momentum and market share.  They haven’t had a full year with Qwest and Savvis, but from this year’s financials we can expect big things.  After all, they seemed to have beaten [analysts’ estimates]( http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/74863/centurylink-beats-estimates-in-1q). And if all goes wrong, we still have their 7% dividend. 

I’ll also note telecommunications is one of two Dow Jones Indices to be in an up trend (the other’s utilities): [basic materials](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUSBM), [consumer goods]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUSnc), [consumer service]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUScy), [financials]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUSfn), [healthcare]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUShc), [industrials]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUSin), [oil and gas]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUSen), [technology]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUStc), [telecommunications]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUStl), and [utilities]( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJUSut)

Edit: We should definitely hold this for the remainder of the year and pay close attention to their earnings announcements. If they start to disappoint analysts then we should dump the stock, otherwise we should keep holding it.

RT delivers consistent cash flow yield and continues to paydown debt while still investing in new channels.  RT is currently trading at a large discount to peers due to historically bad comps in the last three quarters.  However, management has already taken steps to bring comps back up through a combination of store closing and renovation, product overhaul, and a foray into national television advertising. 

Company Overview
RT is a restaurant company that primarily participates in the bar/grill and casual dining space.  It operates the Ruby Tuesday brand, as well as Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Truffles, Marlin &amp; Ray’s, and Wok Hay in 45 states and 14 countries.  Currently, there are 840 RT restaurants, of which 755 are company owned and 85 are licensed out to franchises. The Ruby Tuesday concept offers American cuisine, but is best known for its burgers.  Lime Fresh Mexican Grill serves fast casual Mexican cuisine.  Truffles serves upscale American, while Marlin &amp; Ray’s serves upscale seafood.  Wok Hay, located in Tennessee, serves fast casual Asian food.  All RT restaurants serve alcohol.
RT was founded in Tennessee in 1972 and been listed publically since 1983.  Of the 755 company owned restaurants, approximately 50% are fully owned (land and building), whereas the remainder are 66% building owned only and 34% fully leased.  The fully leased properties are a combination of operating and capital leases.  
For franchises, RT collects $45,000 upfront and a 4.0% royalty fee on sales.  Another 0.5% fee is charged and used for advertising (with authorization to increase this to 3%), a 1.5% for any support services, and 1.5% for marketing fees.  

Industry Overview
RT aims to operate in the bar/grill space, which, although is not a normally classified category, typically falls on the higher end of the casual dining spectrum.  RT’s average ticket is $12.50, placing it with comps such as Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (300 restaurants), Chili’s (owned by Brinker, 830 stores), and BJ’s (118 stores).  Slightly above RT is the Darden group with Red Lobster/Olive Garden (700/750 restaurants, respectively) and Texas Roadhouse (300 restaurants).  Currently, RT sits at the bottom end of casual dining restaurants with same store sales (SSS) growth of -1.3%, 0.9%, and -4.0% (estimated) in FY 2010, 2011, and 2012 (estimated).

Thesis

1.	Sale-leaseback provides a great downside protection and value play: In the last seven quarters, RT has either acquired or divested through sale-leaseback of 119 of these stores.  Sale-leasebacks occur when RT sells the land and building of the restaurant, but leases back the space to operate its restaurant.   Based on current sell rates and lease cap rates, this process allows RT to tap into a huge cash pools.  Using an analysis initially created by Raymond James (and modified by me), RT could possibly generate in excess of $750 million through sale-leasebacks.  After this cash to pay off debt, we realize that RT is effectively trading at 1.25-2.00x EV/EBITDA as the “bear case” scenario.  This is exclusive of any value to the actual operations of the company.  Furthermore, this analysis assumes that the leases are all operating and not capital/direct financed, where in fact RT uses a mix of both.  Lastly, this valuation does not take into the value of building owned/land leased properties, which could also have a significant contribution to RT’s valuation.  Applying a 7x EV/EBITDA multiple (slight discount from peers) and factoring in the value of RT’s real estate results in a downside target price of $11.50.  Looking through a value metric, RT is currently trading at .8x P/TBV, much lower than its average peers at 5x P/TBV.  

2.	A shift into television advertising: RT has been the laggard in marketing: this quarter will be the first with a national rollout of television ads (which actually just started this past year).  While its peers initated TV advertising much earlier, RT spent $80-90 million a year primarily on couponing.  As a result, RT has felt the pressure and is currently sitting last in its peer group in SSS this year.  This year, RT has already spent ~$20 million on TV ads, and plans to spend $45-50 million in FY 2013.  Luckily, RT is in the middle of a cost savings initiative, and expects to be able to offset most of these additional expenses.  By doing so, I believe that SG&amp;A, as a proportion of revenues, will not increase significantly, while the improved marketing will bring SSS close to breakeven.

3.	Better focus, better restaurants, new concepts: RT has been aggressively cleaning up its image by acquiring suboptimal franchisees (average revenue of 700k per store as opposed to company owned stores of 1,700k), renovating restaurants, and creating new menus and offerings.  Since 2009, RT has closed 100 stores, primarily ones that are in close proximity with another RT concept.  In Q4 2012, RT is expected to close another 26 stores, and 8 more in 2013.  In Q1 2011, RT rolled out a new menu, offers complementary bread, and is now offering a free “fresh garden bar” to customers who purchase an entrée (starting price of $9.99).  CapEx has also ramped up this year, as RT is overhauling its restaurants with new tables and bathrooms.  

Additionally, RT is expanding more aggressively through its other store concepts.  RT plans to open 10 Marlin &amp; Ray’s in 2013, which will push margins slightly higher through its higher priced seafood options.  In early 2011, RT began a licensing partnership with Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, a Miami based casual dining restaurant with double digit SSS growth.  Subsequently, in Q4 2012, RT purchased Lime Fresh for $24 million at under a 10x multiple.  RT is quickly scaling up Lime Fresh stores at a pace of one per month.  For 2013, RT believes Lime Fresh can add 20 new stores, and 30 stores a year after that.

4.	When you’re this far down, almost anything becomes positive: At effectively negative SSS the past 5 quarters, RT is currently the worst in its category.  
However, RT has an experienced management team and is taking the right steps to reverse course.  The CapEx is has occurred through renovations, cost savings should push margins up, and the TV advertising is in its first legs.  Even a negative 1-2% SSS would be a positive sign.

5.	Highly cash-flow generative: Forward FCF yield is at ~10%.  Management’s been actively paying down debt (see cash flow from financing) and tapping into sale-leasebacks to fund growth.

6.	Buyout candidate? RT appointed two new board members, both managing partners at Becker Drapkin Management, L.P., after they filed a 13D with Carlson Capital (6.4% total stake).  These activist investors could push the board towards a private equity deal, expecially considering the 1.25 to 2.00x EV/adjusted EBITDA RT is currently at.  The rest of the board consists of the founder/CEO/Chairman Sandy Beal and 10+ year veterans of the board (all but one).

Risks

1.	Management spends the cash foolishly: So far, I believe that management has taken the correct steps with regards to acquisitions, maintenance/growth capex, and expenses.  Lime Fresh was purchased at a decent multiple, relatively small ($24 million), and was effectively taken through a licensing/trial run before actual implementation.  However, given the cash generation and sale-leasebacks, management might be faced with temptations to spend cash unwisely in further acquisitions.  Furthermore, RT had a secondary offering in FY 2010, and has historically not paid out dividends, which may cause shareholder concerns.  

2.	Comps continue to decrease, unable to complete sale-leasebacks: Although effective, sale leasebacks are still relatively new and are being used marginally.  If there was a large shock to RT (either through market or debt servicing), a larger scale sale-leaseback may be required.  There isn’t evidence that a willing buyer could step up, leading to cash shortages in the short term (quick ratio is &lt;1, but climbing).  We already evidenced a secondary offering in the past, which could have been a result of cash shortages.  Furthermore, if comps continue to decrease at such a rapid pace, RT may not be around to realize the improvements in renovation and marketing. Lower comps could also lead to more store closings and an even longer recovery, if any.   

3.	Lime Fresh becomes a lemon: A lot is being invested into the Lime Fresh brand as it rolls out in the next few years.  Management is considering up to $15 million in growth capex specifically for Lime Fresh, and optimistically sees the channel producing $30 million of incremental EBITDA.  A shift away from fast casual dining or geographical difficulties (Lime Fresh is currently only in the southeast) could be devastating to RT’s growth prospects.  

Valuation

I believe that RT can re-expand its store counts up to ~1000 (including franchises) due to the less concentrated portfolio of Ruby Tuesday, Lime Fresh, and Marlin &amp; Ray’s concepts.  My assumptions for Q4 2012 and FY 2013 were more conservative than the street, but I am bullish about RT’s cash flow generating abilities further down the line.  Based off a DCF, I reach a target price of $12.25.  I also used the sale-leaseback cash flows two different ways, method 1 assuming 100% operating leases and method 2 backing into capital leases assuming 50% have already been paid off.  I reach a share price of $11.50 with this method.

vmsv2,[BUY] Allergan Inc. (NYSE:AGN),t3_vmsv2,"Allergan is a multi-specialty health care firm who develops and commercializes medical applications which include: ophthalmic (vision), neurological (nervous system), aesthetics (cosmetic surgery), dermatology (skin disorders), obesity, and urological.



*I previously recommended Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) but realized the portfolio is too concentrated in the auto sector given that Ford and Tesla have been picked.*



Allergan has a market cap of over $27 billion, forward P/E at approximately 19, PEG at approximately 2. Quick ratio at approximately 4, D/E at approximately 0.3 and it pays out a small dividend with a yield just above 0.2% and a payout ratio of around 6%. Revenue growth has averaged approximately 9% every year for the past decade, cash flows from operations and R&amp;D expenses have held steady in the $200 million range for the past decade. It has sales all over the world with a solid product line in separate distinct medical specialties. For further details and other stats, please see references below.



**I believe Allergan is a solid long-term buy for one main reason, demographics.** As the population ages, healthcare spending is expected to increase. The bulk of Allergan’s net sales come from eye care, notably Restasis (dry eyes) and Lumigan (Glaucoma). Note that Glaucoma is the seconding leading cause of blindness (more stats in the references link). Aesthetics is another major area the firm specializes in. With an aging population and the media constantly encouraging perfection, this is another area that I expect significant growth. Allergan’s products include skin care, breast aesthetics and facial aesthetics. Lastly, I would also like to touch on Allergan’s obesity intervention product line (Lap-Band). America’s fight with obesity is largely publicized; however, [China with a massive population is also showing signs of obesity problems](http://uschina.usc.edu/w_usci/showarticle.aspx?articleID=16595&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1). This is another potential large market for Allergan. Also note that as China’s wealth increases, demand for cosmetic/aesthetics will also increase providing yet another source of growth.



For the sake of a Reddit post, I will end it here.  Of course, there is much more research that should be included including competitors, currency risk, other risk factors, etc., however I will just leave some links below for reference and let others mention them in the comments section.



Note: I personally would like to see a pull back to $85 before purchasing. In summary, I like Allergan’s product line and believe due to demographic forces, the firm’s future is very bright.

wn53y,[BUY] MKS Instruments Inc. (MKSI),t3_wn53y,"[MKS Instruments is a small company](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MKSI) (MKCAP 1.41B) with a price of $26.48. They are a seller of measurement tools for manufacturing and pipelines of all sorts(NG, NGL, oil etc..) worldwide. As demand for energy increases and as manufacturing takes a swing around in the US, this undervalued stock could provide significant gains going forward. Below I will try my hand at some fundamental analysis, take a look at the industry numbers for relative analysis, understand their cash flows and ask for your opinion at the end. This is part of the way that I look at stocks, if you disagree, please say so in the comments but leave the hate at home.


Analysis:

Their current ratio is outstanding, about $10 for every dollar of debt. The company does indeed have debt but it is small enough for just tax shield. Since they are a small player they have to play by small rules which means minimal debt. Their strategy in the industry is to do broad diversification in which they try to stay in all markets where they operate, some times with low cost products and sometimes putting in R&amp;D for very high-end products. Either way they are getting a piece of the action of every industry they operate in while controlling costs.

Current Ratio

    03/31/12    10.11

    12/31/11    9.18
The quick ratio is still strong, you can see that their inventory will not eat them if they loose on sales in a quarter. With an ROA of 10, they are quite efficient and an inventory turnover rate of 2.7 (turn over is fairly quickly), they are getting their products to market.

Quick Ratio

    03/31/12    8.41

    12/31/11    7.58

They are bringing in cash on the operating level at a high rate.

Operating Margin
    03/31/12    14.40

    12/31/11    15.55

Given all these good signs, there has been some bad with the company, their sales were down 17% last quarter. However this is an industry wide phenomenon and is due to the slowdown in China and many parts of Europe where their utilities are used. However as we see a rebound in small manufacturing taking place in the US, [more in San Fran than anywhere else right now](http://www.monocle.com/sections/design/Web-Articles/Make-Do-Change/) , I expect that they will be focused more domestically going forward.

Cash Flows are strong and steadily increasing year-over-year. This is seen on the cash flow statement. The dividend is yielding around 2% and stock buyback has been in the plan of the company for sometime and has been happening yearly. Basically management say what it does when it comes to equity and the fact they have increasing retained earnings shows that even though they spend money on shareholder value they are not spending all of earnings to do so.


Price to Book is 1.5ish and the beta is hovering around 1.8. This means that the stocks equity is somewhat fairly valued but is a mover in the market when news hits or announcements are made. It comes with risk, but since the cash flows are so strong (before Free Cash Flow) it's hard to say that the risk is unacceptable.


The free cash flows, yes I will agree it's a concern, but I have to also look at the trend, while it's been decreasing over time, the reason is because the company has been focusing on stock buybacks and reinvestment. Even after all of that FCF still exsits for the investor and after dividends are paid there is still money in the bucket.


VS The industry MKSI outperforms most areas except most notably this year's expected growth. It is below industry, but as stated about given the broad diversification and given the macro pullback period it is more likely a short term trend than a full on deterioration of the company.


Please remember as you take a look, it's a small company, susceptible to swings and could be more risky than a company like Coke. However, since it is small it could be possible to get stellar gains since they are in a market that provides the fundamentals for a manufacturing plant which is always a necessity.

x422q,[buy] Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE: SLB),t3_x422q,"http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ASLB&amp;authuser=1

This stock is not a big oil company, rather it is a supporting industry. Schlumberger is one of a few companies that actually do the drilling that big oil requires. It can drill in various directions, not simply vertical, which makes it immensely valuable, as its 3D mapping and directional drilling capability makes it able to tap into wells previously abandoned as being fully exploited.

The company spends huge amounts of its money on R&amp;D to stay at the head of the game, but also has huge profits for given revenue, for instance a $5 billion revenue on a $40 billion revenue most recently.
With oil use expanding and new discoveries shrinking, the future of the oil industry is exploitation of those wells already abandoned by others as fully tapped, alongside those that are in difficult locations such as the Arctic and the pre-salt layers off the coast of Brazil.

The recent acquisition of Smith International, a drill bit company, has added numerous technologies and persons of expertise able to expand the company's R&amp;D and also drill virtually all types of oil reserves, including Brazil's pre-salt oil layers, which are notoriously difficult to tap into. 

Also, Schlumberger is at a good time to buy in its history of stock price. It's chart shows that its stock price is quite low considering its history, and as economies the world over recover, companies like Schlumberger stand to make huge profits on the investments they have made. 

This is of course my first post in this subreddit and I'm buying into this stock and advocating its use, so any and all feedback is more than welcome!

yo73v,[DISCUSS] Why was Ford ever bought?,t3_yo73v,"This is the thread I assume instigated the buy on F, posted 5 months ago:

http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/ql347/ford_thoughts_buy/

I'm wary about the lack of analysis that led to a buy on, what has been proven to be, a very sub-par pick. There was no reasoning in the thread to support a Buy recommendation. What's most concerning, however, is that the recommendation makes absolutely no mention of the deferred tax benefit, which resulted in $11.5 billion of unusable earnings, accounting for *more than half* of F's earnings for the entire year. The reason that this line item should not be included is because it accounts for F's trapped overseas cash, that the company can't use without paying the $11.5 billion in income taxes should it desire to repatriate said cash. If you removed this extraordinary line item from normalized earnings, EPS would've dropped from 5.33 to 2.29, and the quarterly trend would have remained negative instead of been skewed towards positive.

If you look at quarterly earnings, it becomes VERY apparent that there was some non-recurring one-time line item(s) that were skewing the numbers... no idea why this was not dug into:

| |Q2'11|Q3'11|Q4'11|Q1'12|Q2'12|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|EPS|0.65|0.44|3.34|0.39|0.33|

Guess which quarter had the one-time gain?

Seems like a pretty huge oversight for such a basic analysis.",benyBC,InvestmentClub,2012-08-23 01:42:33,2,12,12,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/yo73v/discuss_why_was_ford_ever_bought/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/yo73v/discuss_why_was_ford_ever_bought/,True,False,,,,,,,

zh7xv,[BUY] Archer Daniel Midlands (NYSE:ADM),t3_ywlgr,"[Archer Daniel Midlands](http://www.adm.com/en-US/Pages/default.aspx) is a company that works in one of the most vital industries required for human survival; food! Think of all the products you consume: cereal, beverages or candy, they most likely contain ingredients produced by ADM. 



ADM, currently trading at $27.36, has an $18Bn market cap with over 30,000 employees operating worldwide. The firm has a P/E ratio of approximately 15, forward P/E ratio of approximately 12 and PEG ratio of 1.5. Current ratio is 1.8 and D/E is approximately 0.6. Furthermore, at the current price, ADM pays a dividend of 2.56% and its payout ratio is 37%.



Its products include food ingredients (cocoa, corn, flours, oilseeds, etc.) which makes its way into: baking products, cereals, candy, dairy products, meats, and processed foods. ADM also provides animal feeds for cattle, sheep, horses, etc. Furthermore, ADM is active in the biofuels market (ethanol and biodiesel). Closer to home, ADM products also finds their way into detergents, cleaners, packaging, paints, and paper. Notice how all of the products are used/consumed on a daily basis without much thought.



I believe in the long-run, due to demographic and economic shifts, ADM is a good candidate for any portfolio as they operate in the agricultural sector which should see strong demand in the coming decades.



Note: I admit I did not do as much research as my other recommendations (see below) so if you have any questions, I probably can’t answer them. I wrote this piece to generate more activity in this subreddit.

10873u,[BUY] Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS),t3_ywlgr,"[Bank of Nova Scotia](http://www.scotiabank.com/gls/en/index.html#about) is one of Canada’s big 5 banks. I have already written a recommendation for TD Bank before. Comparatively, TD is generally said to be a safer investment with their focus organic (retail banking) growth, while BNS is deemed riskier.



BNS is currently trading at 54.77 and has a market capitalization of over $64 Billion. Its PE ratio is approximately 10.6, forward PE ratio is approximately 10.6 and PEG ratio is approximately 1.2. It pays a healthy dividend of 4.2% and its payout ratio is approximately 38%. Note that Canadian banks have a history of consistent dividend increases and its oligopoly status in the Canadian marketplace ensures consistent earnings and future dividend increases.



I believe BNS is a great investment because of its domestic and international growth opportunities.



Domestically, the purchase of ING Direct Canada (Q3 2012) was in my opinion a great acquisition. It has a fiercely loyal customer base and for good reason. There are no fees and service charges for almost everything (for most people, they will not have to pay anything, even if they have a 0 balance. There are a couple items which require you to pay like $1 for interact e-transfers. They have also introduced a chequing account which has $25 NSF fees (and that is really the fault of the customer), but mostly everything else is free. [ING plans to introduce credit cards and possibly a discount brokerage in the future]( http://business.financialpost.com/2012/09/20/ing-direct-to-double-customers-offer-credit-cards-thanks-to-scotiabank-deal/). I believe these will be quickly adopted by their current customers, and they will also be able to grow their customer base and reach their projected targets. A strong ING base should also translate into good results for retail banking at Scotia.



BNS is also known as Canada’s most international bank. (Net income is broken down as follows: ~30% Canadian banking, ~25% international banking, ~20% Global Wealth management, ~25% capital markets). BNS is active in fast growing markets such as Peru, Thailand, China, and Colombia.



*Note: If I was investing an actual portfolio, I would start to think about phasing out my winners to the end of 2012 (or possibly earlier depending on upcoming market news &amp; data) and moving into market neutral strategies (pairs trade) such as long EWC and short EWP early 2013 assuming no big changes.*

Sunwin Stevia International, Inc. engages in the areas of zero calorie, all natural sweeteners (Sunwin Stevia™ Extracts).  As an industry leader in agricultural processing, Sunwin has built an integrated global firm with the sourcing and production capabilities to meet the needs of consumers throughout the world. 

Recently Lady Gaga endorsed a soft drink called Popwaters with a company that uses Sunwin's Stevia. http://www.waterwentpop.com/pop-water.html

This might be a huge pop if the soft drink is successful, especially when it's backed by international mega stars.

There seems to be a lot of PR activity from the company as well as a steady rise in price.

Although its stock price was down by 64% after The FDA panel voted 13 to 1 against its lead product candidate Tivopath, and it is highly likely FDA will decline its application by July 28th, it will be approved someday! And its price will be at least 10 times higher in a not long future. That’s how it works with biotech companies. With $180MM cash on hand, and more milestones coming from its partners. The company has enough fund and sources to have Tivopath get approved!
Today it closed at $2.59, which is even lower than its book value per share $2.86. Not to mention its has full support from its five strategic partners: Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Astellas Pharma, Biogen Idec, OSI Pharmaceuticals, Centocor Ortho Biotech and Schering-Plough Corporation (now Merck)  
It is eligible to receive an aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion in potential future milestone payments from its its main partner Astellas, comprised of (i) up to $85 million in substantive milestone payments upon achievement of specified clinical and development milestone events, (ii) up to $475 million in substantive milestone payments upon achievement of specified regulatory milestone events, including up to $75 million in milestone payments in connection with specified regulatory filings, and receipt of marketing approvals, for tivozanib to treat RCC in the United States and Europe, and (iii) up to approximately $780 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified commercial sales events.
It will also receive an option exercise fee of $5.0 million and regulatory milestone payments of up to $45.0 million in the aggregate if Biogen Idec exercises its option to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize ErbB3 antibody products in its territory.
Under its agreement with OSI, it will receive a milestone payment that is a $2.0 million clinical and development milestone for phase 1 clinical trial dosing. The next regulatory milestone payment it may receive pursuant to this agreement is $7.0 million to be achieved for the filing of an NDA with the FDA. It is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on sales of products by OSI, its affiliates and sublicensees. Upon commercialization of products which were part of the research program under the agreement.

1ehsoc,Need some help with a commission/broker agreement,t3_ywlgr,"Hi - please bear with me - I hope this is the right sub to ask this question. First time question-asker.

Recently, a former colleague who has joined what appears to be a great startup came through town with his management team. They're raising a final pre-IPO round of equity, and have engaged two big banks to manage the issue - one within the USA, the other for rest-of-world. The company and the banks are open to including other investors on the registry whom I am able to originate interest from - naturally the commission on the monies will go to the two banks, but we have agreed a deal I am happy with. Having worked in banks most of my career, the shafting feels pretty natural.

On the investor side, I understand that it's standard for a fee to be charged by the broker (me in this case), and I have a feel for pricing, and when the agreement should be signed. I just don't have an Agreement document, nor do I know exactly what to put in it that would specifically relate to this service. 

If anyone out there has any advice - up to and including (gulp) sending me a copy of a similar agreement - I will be extremely grateful. Happy to share private details.

I should mention that the regulations where I am exempt me from any licensing requirements for this activity, so all is okay with that.

I should also mention at this point for theatrical effect and potential sympathetic resonance that I have been out of work since last year after brain surgery (four in fact), so my friend throwing this to me is a real break, and I am loathe to spend dwindling money reserves on legal advice, even though I know that's what I should do. If push comes to shove and nothing surfaces here, that's my last resort. Lawyers. Awesome.

Reddits - please help! Many thanks indeed - prosper outrageously.

I have been interested in SHMDF for a while, my only reservation being they are an OTC-Pink market traded stock, which means the stats I am about to give you are, or course, limited.

SHMDF:

* Currently trading at 82.10 with a market cap at 7.61B
* EPS is 3.86
* Revenue (ttm) is 3.13B, per share 33.81
* 52 week change 31.36%

Shimano Inc. is a Japanese multinational manufacturer of cold forging parts for the automotive industry, cycling components, rowing equipment, and fishing tackle. They have continuous innovations in their respective product areas, however, have been unsuccessful with pushing products in some newer areas such as snowboarding and golf, though still continue to find new markets for potential products.

What do you think about Shimano Inc. as a company? Would an OTC-pink stock be a good addition to the portfolio? Is there a better OTC-pink company we should look at instead? Thanks!

I've got zero experience or knowledge as far as investing. I'm not concerned with the money its self, it's less than $250 and I feel that the hands on learning would be worth the price if I lost it rather than just cashing out and spending it or putting in savings.

The company currently has about $273m in debt at a 16% rate they intend to refinance this year, and the SJT plant helped Ram turn a $10.7m profit in the first quartet of 2013. Using a NPV calculation for the cash flows through 2039 ( the length of the agreement) with a 10% discount rate (and given some FCF assumptions from the power agreement) comes out to right about $600m. Adding the debt back along with other assets (in a liquidation type scenario), the equity value comes to $350m; if this company shut down tomorrow, the current ~300m shares would be worth over a dollar. This all comes after many years of losing wads of cash.

There is much more to this story, including the risks and opportunities of operating in Nicaragua, other early development projects, and a renewed commitment to shareholder value by management. All of these and more are explained in the original article that put me onto this security.

As to how this fits into the portfolio - I recognize this is a speculative investment, but there is significant upside potential here and limited downside. An outlay of $15,000 at a limit price of $0.23 would buy 65,130 shares (factoring in commission), representing approx. 1.33% of the total value of the current Investment Club portfolio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.  
Price Target - $65, 30% Upside, 2 year horizon*



**Thesis**

ANF is an atypical value play with underappreciated growth.  Stores in Europe/Asia generate over 3x/5x (respectively) revenues of domestic stores and will sustain a longer cycles due to different and misunderstood customer preferences.  Earnings trade at a discount to peers/historical; trading at 2x tangible book and generates FCF yield at 9%.  Combined with a small dividend yield of 1.7% and constant share repurchases, I believe that ANF is a great long-term investment with significant revenue/earnings growth, cash flow generation, and shareholder friendly management.

**1.	Market trades off SSS, which is the wrong metric to use due to international and inorganic growth.  This results in significant mispricing/opportunities**

Nov 2012 - One day jump of ~35% when market realized that even with negative SSS, ANF still generates impressive earnings and cash flow.  This will occur again as Asian market reaches critical mass, growth accelerates and flows through to bottom line.
Europe – 20% growth with new stores at 3x domestic revenues; currently mid-cycle.  Asia – very early cycle, with stores at 5x revenues and minimal penetration.

**2.	Asian customer is fundamentally different, which will stretch growth cycle longer than domestic 5 year cycle (ANF 2001-2005, Hollister 2005-2009)**

*Different demographics:* Overseas customer is 14-40 years old, instead of 14-22 domestically.  ANF remains a popular brand to celebrities.  This results in more replacement cycles for the same customer and also appeals to a more affluent market as well.
 
*Pent-up demand:* ANF clothing has traditionally been a significant import into Asia (brought by relatives, friends, visitors).  Willingness to pay for authentic products mitigates the presence of fakes.

*Iconic American “lifestyle”:* ANF fashion has less variation (similar strategy to Ralph Lauren, fad resistant) and is currently the dominant Americana brand.  No near term competitors.

**Market does not realize these factors, thinks that new stores are just in an unsustainable “honeymoon” period.**

**3.	Smarter store opening strategy internationally and rationalization of US stores will improve margins (which are currently near industry lows)**

Criteria for new stores is 30% 4 wall margin (op inc – SG&amp;A – opening exp).  This prevents cannibalization, which depressed domestic sales in the past.  Underperforming domestic stores are being closed as well. US rev/store has grown 4 years in a row

Total flagship stores: 

USA – 266, Europe – 11, Asia – 4, so there is huge room for growth.  No MEA/LatAm presence.

Europe price premium to US is 48% for ANF and 42% for Hollister.  

**4.	Domestic decline is overhyped, total domestic sales (including online) increased 1% in 2012.  With 20+% online growth, domestic sales should remain positive Y/Y**

Driven by a combination of promotional activity, stronger online presence, and new loyalty programs

**5.	Strong capital allocation and cash flow provide downside protection**

15x NTM P/E, slight discount to peers and historical.  FCF of 9%, 1.6% div yield.  Share repurchases have increased 3 years in a row, with 18m (23% of shares out) shares remaining.  Net cash position, trading at 2x tangible book.  


**Risks**

**1.	Bad decisions for new locations – such as Fukuoka, Japan**

Mitigant: Management needs to remain focused on 30% 4 wall margins, not other factors such as cheaper rent

**2.	Europe SSS is decreasing heavily**

Mitigant: Comps are coming off a huge initial base and softness in southern European.  Long term revenue per store to still exceed domestic stores by at least 2x.  

**3.	Limited fashion trendiness due to recycled and similar fashion**
Mitigant: Less seasonality than other brands, and although this hurt ANF domestically, its reinforces the American lifestyle brand, which results in a competitive advantage overseas.

1jgpxu,[Buy] Thoughts on ARMH?,t3_ywlgr,"I'd like to open up for discussion a long position on ARM holdings.

http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AARMH&amp;ei=j7f5UZC1MpPalAOU8gE

http://chart.finance.yahoo.com/z?s=armh&amp;t=6m&amp;q=l&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;p=m50,e200,v&amp;a=p12,p&amp;c=%5EDJI&amp;region=de&amp;lang=us-EN

Arm holdings receives licensing royalties for all ARM processer designs (which are in the vast majority of mobile phones and tablets). Unlike intel they do not actually make the chips, which seems to resonate with mobile platform developers that want more control over their product update cycles.

Last quarter seemed to be the only recent subpar quarter which may have caused a bit of overselling. The new iphone(s)  may kick this stock back up in the fall since i feel all those old iphone 4 owners that have been satisfied with their phones will finally decide to upgrade when iOS7 does not run well on their old phones.

The PE is pretty high (84), but i suppose should be expected for the growth they are experiencing.

edit: http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/arm-holdings-plc-adr-armh-vs-intel-corporation-intc-the-calm-before-the-storm-207780/
 this suggests that the recent surge and slight drop may be due to the hype and failure of msft's surface RT tablet which is based on ARM architecture. Im not too sure its a big deal tbh. IMO As long as iOS and Android keep rolling on ARM processor architectures, the money should keep rolling in.

1jka7q,"[short] Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA)",t3_ywlgr,"I think it is pretty well accepted that TSLA is overvalued at its current price of $135. Martket cap is at 15.66B. That's almost one quarter of Ford's market cap of 67.72B and one thirteenth of Toyota's 200B market cap.

1js2sx,[Buy] Himax Technologies Inc.,t3_ywlgr,"Himax ([HIMX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=himx&amp;ei=APT_UZm-PM6L0QG3Zg)) is as close as you can get to a pure play for Google's upcoming [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/what-it-does/). Throughout the first quarter rumors that Himax was making the display to be used in Glass drove the price from around $2.00 up to ~$6.50, then in Q2 it traded down to $5.50 after teardowns of the Explorer units didn't specifically identify the Himax display. In mid-June, a notable display engineer [all but confirmed](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1504292-proof-that-google-glass-uses-a-himax-lcos-microdisplay) the display was from HIMX, and a month later in mid-July Google verified it by [buying](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-to-take-stake-in-himax-techs-display-unit-2013-07-22) a 6% stake in the company, with an option to increase their stake to nearly 15%. This drove the stock price back to the $7.50-6.50 range where it sits now.

[Google Glass is cool,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BTCoT8ajbI) and if it is as cheap to produce [as it appears](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CE0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fmarkrogowsky%2F2013%2F06%2F12%2Fgoogle-likely-to-shatter-the-price-of-glass-ahead-of-widespread-release%2F&amp;ei=zUYAUo6rL8r64APb64GQCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNELuBqFVSNM-TzRJzaszrdYivoPjA&amp;sig2=R-Bm7fWpKH3I9LakXJceBQ), Google, who has been aggressive with their hardware pricing in the past (N4 and N7), could price Glass as low as $200 - $300, which happens to be the price at which [half of those polled say that would buy it](http://www.webpronews.com/how-much-would-you-pay-for-google-glass-most-say-200-2013-05).

1k1wuu,[BUY] Total SA (TOT),t3_ywlgr,"Total SA is a France-based vertically integrated oil and gas company, one of the six ""supermajors."" Of those six, its operations in the United States are the most limited. Instead, Total focuses on being a major operator in Western Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. 

In Total, I see an attractive valuation based on two factors: underperformance by the oil &amp; gas industry as a whole thus far in 2013 and the lagging recovery of European markets. While the media is abuzz about TSLA, we're still years away from when renewable energy will dethrone big oil. Looking beyond Q2 2013, Total's steady growth since bottoming out midway through 2012 is not likely to be reversed anytime soon. Additionally, Total is currently trading at a P/E of 9.61, which is not exceptionally high for the industry. I look at this as a long-term investment, and it's worth noting that Total has committed capital to majority stakes in multiple renewable energy firms. While not yet fully monetized, these assets are sure to be valuable when the eventual transition to renewables does begin, especially since multiple other firms, most notably BP, have recently divested themselves of renewable investments. These assets and infrastructure are valuable, yet the current emphasis on oil means that their potential doesn't inflate the P/E too much. 

On top of all of this, Total (with a beta of 1.03) stands to capitalize on the eventual recovery of Western European markets, which are beginning to show signs of recovery. Total's stock can ride a European recovery to attractive gains, while I am somewhat bearish on oil firms with greater involvement in the American market. The growing movement for institutional divestment from fossil fuel companies could easily knock a firm like XOM or HES down a few points, through either divestment itself or mainstream media coverage of the movement. Total is shielded from this threat by operating a little more outside of the eye of the American public and by having only 7% of its shares owned by institutional investors (vs. 50% for XOM and 79% for HES). 

Lastly, Total's dividend payments yield an attractive 5.66%, which is not solely a factor of its current share price. Going back several years to before the financial crisis, biannual (now quarterly) dividends were as high as 1.87%. 

As far as fitting within the portfolio, Total's operations fully encompass those of SLB, but the downside potential of each firm is based on wholly different factors. We're already in France Telecom, but again the businesses are very different and I believe that Total has much more potential for growth (internet and phone services were likely sustained through the European crisis, and so the share price may not see a resurgence soon) and expansion (given Total's extensive operations in Africa). 

Regarding the sale of Total, I'm long but would consider selling if the company's dividends don't scale appropriately with an increase in share price, or if its operations in renewables or emerging markets begin to be threatened by an as-yet-unknown firm - that is, if the company begins to fall short of properly exploiting its advantage in either field.

1kbfsu,[BUY] PRGO,t3_ywlgr,"Perrigo is a company that I see rising significantly, and will continue to report higher earnings in the upcoming quarters.

It is expected to report earnings of up to 22% from a year ago (August 15th), EPS of ~$1.56.

Its mean target is $136.87, median target at $144, and high target at  $150. This according to 15 brokers. The majority rate it as a buy, and a few a strong buy.

Given that its earnings are 2 days from now, I for sure see the $136.87 on Thursday/Friday, given the predicted increase of volume as well.

PRGO competes with ACT, RDY, and NVS. Its net income is higher than ACT, and RDY in which ACT is much bigger.

1ko1av,E*TRADE screws me over one last time (I hope).,t3_ywlgr,"Hi, folks.




About six years ago, I had a little extra cash to gamble, so I started an E*TRADE account. Great timing, right? Luckily, I mainly invested in Apple stock. Hurray for me! I got in at about $100 a share. Good growth, so no worries. In fact, as it approached $200 with great things on the horizon, I decided, what the hell, may as well buy some more on margin. (Stupid, right?) Here is where things go sour.





See, I had signed up for E*TRADE to contact me electronically. They were sending me emails about new info daily, particularly about other stocks to buy. This happened even *during* the big crash in 2008. Want to know what they *didn't* email me about? The margin call they put on my account! That, they posted one message on their website.





Having faith in my Apple stock, I did not look at my E*TRADE account for a week. They sold most of it. Right before it gained all of its old value. And then some.


Since they had stolen...er, sold... most of my Apple stock, I was now under their minimum value, so they started charging me fees on my account if there was no activity. So, I cashed in all of my account, except for about $5 of penny stocks. Why? It would have cost me more to withdraw it than it was worth.





So, years go by, and I am sent a notice that I now owe them $4 on a margin call because, after one of my penny stocks tripled in value, the company converted to another form of stock, and the fee associated with this from E*TRADE brought me *under* zero. So I called and officially killed my account, which I probably should have done in the first place.

Well, the rep on the phone was helpful, removed the fee, killed my account, and sent me a check for the just under $14 I had remaining.





Guess what? They then put a hold on the check. So, they ended up costing me and *extra* $15.

I have contacted them, and they are cutting me a new check for the original value plus the bank fee. I wonder if this one will also get a hold?





At least their phone reps are nice.





**TL; DR**: E*TRADE screws me out thousands in unfair margin call, then puts an unfair hold on the check they send me to close my account.

1l04xg,[Question] Long vs Short term capital gains tax rates and cost basis calculations.,t3_ywlgr,"When I sell a security that I've bought at multiple prices and multiple times, some greater than one year ago and some less than one year ago, how is the cost basis calculated and how much of the capital gains is long term and how much is short term?
_________________________________
Say I purchased 10 shared of stock A at $100 a share 1.5 years ago.  And then I purchased 10 more shares at $150 a share 6 months ago.  If I sell 50% of my holdings today at $200 a share, what tax will I owe?

If I could choose which shares to sell and they were kept separate, I would sell the older ones because the the capital gains tax rate will be 20% and my profit will be $100 per share. I will owe $200 of tax on the $1000 profit.  

If my broker just calculates an average cost basis of $125 per share and I cannot decide which shares to sell, I would have to claim only $750 of profit but clearly some of that profit should be taxed at 40%. But how much?

And here is a report on 3D Workspace - http://www.advancedphotonix.com/documents/pdf/Custom%20Array%20for%203D%20Workspace.pdf

ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 7, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Advanced Photonix® (NYSE MKT: API), today announced that Picometrix, LLC, an API wholly owned subsidiary, has introduced a new 100G coherent receiver and has increased its supply chain capacity to meet demand in the growing 100G coherent optical communications market.

The new product is based on the industry standard CCRx MSA and OIF compliant CR-100A package and further expands the Picometrix industry leading 100G product family. The innovative receiver integrates a variable optical attenuator (VOA) on the signal path and is designed to increase dynamic range, as well as improve optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) performance. The receiver (CR-100D) spans the entire extended C and L band wavelengths and can be used in ""colorless"" coherent networks that enable service providers to better manage network capacity. Colorless capabilities allow communication equipment to utilize any wavelength for any port at the add/drop site. This allows for faster data throughput and lower costs per bit transport, both of which are big concerns for the industry. The CR-100D is available with or without a VOA.

Its gross profit has increased, and overall net income has increased as well compared to past years. I have high expectations for this company.

1m67sn,2 A stock I own is down 12% in pre-market trading. How can I get out in order to cut losses?,t3_ywlgr,"A stock I own is down 12% in pre market trading to about $59.

I'm assuming the stock will open at the pre-market amount and not dip heavily off the start. How can I make sure to cut any potential loss? I bought in the stock around 64 and don't feel comfortable taking any losses.

Can a limit order below yesterday's closing price do the trick? Or am I going to have to suck it up and take the loss like a man?

Basically I'm just unsure as to the influence pre-market trading will have on the stocks price come market open.

Thanks in advance! I hope everyone (including myself) sees green come the closing bell!

1m7sxk,[BUY] Annaly Capital Management NLY,t3_ywlgr,"The Company owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities, including mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans.

Similar to my other pick TLK, NLY is trading near a 52 week low, except in this case, NLY is recovering from that 10.63 low (currently trading at 11.68). For the quarter ending 12-31-12, NLY had revenues of 756 MM which has dropped to 713 MM for the quarter ending 6-30-13 (5.7%) decrease. However, the stock price has fallen from ~15.50 (a 24.7%) decrease. 

This is the disproportionate drop which leads NLY to be undervalued. On top of that, with the fed probably extending the buying of bonding leading to low interest rates, NLY will be less volatile. Coupled with a 14% dividend rate, NLY should be a safe pick coming into the next quarter and beyond.

Since the pricing of this stock has held somewhat stable (even through the crash of 08 09) this is a long term hold for dividends.

1peg6g,[Buy] Weight Watchers Xpost from /r/investing,t3_ywlgr,"Hello /r/investmentclub 

I originally posted this in /r/investing and was told to xpost here. 
I would like to point out that my post isn't 100% detailed like it should be and that many other points were answered by me in the comments of the original thread on /r/investing.

*Disclaimer I am invested since last July*

Here is my analysis of WTW or Weight Watchers. 

Hello fellow investors, 

I have recently completed an analysis of this company WTW and felt like sharing my finding to this subreddit.

First off, for those who don't know about [Weight Watchers](http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx) a simple look on their website will give you a general idea of what they do. 

Now on to the analysis I should point out that*all figures will be in thousands unless stated otherwise* 

**Balance sheet**

- Total loans of 2 406 364$. 
-  3.1 billions market cap with a share price of 52$ as of December 31st 2012 and 60 millions shares give or take. This gives us a total Capitalization of 6 billions. 
- Current assets were of 217 967$ and current liabilities were of 447 855$ giving us a current ratio of 0.49. Average 5 years ratio were of 209 585$ and 502 475$ respectively.
- Long term debt until 2016 is of 287 853$ with an effective weighted average rate of 2.20%. 
- No preferred stocks issued

So on a quick glance what we have is a small market cap company with a whole lot of debt maturing primarily after 2016. If you are familiar with Security Analysis you remember that Graham called those Speculative Capitalization structured companies. It has it's pros and cons that I'll discuss more in detail later on. 

**Income statement**

-Revenues of 1 828 812$, 5 year average of 1 606 546$
- Depreciation of 36 640$, 5 year average of 29 808$
- Interest charges of 90 537$, 5 year average of 77 196$
- Net income of 257 426$, 5 year average of 227 640 
- 14% profit margin in line with the last 5 years and a 2.84 2.95 times interest charges from the net income. 
- EPS for the last 4 years were as follows     
      2009: 2.30$        
      2010: 2.56$
      2011: 4.11$
      2012: 4.23$


So what we have is a company that is growing revenues and net income on a yearly basis but not at a steady pace. The hikes are very pronounced and so are the lows. It is a very cyclical business as we can expect from the weight management sector. 
They are managing their expenses accordingly judging by the stability of the net income margin over time only negative is the interest charges that have increased substantially in 2012 due to the massive debt undertaking in that year. 


**Cash Flow time** lol 

I'm not gonna spend much time on this part mainly because it is so easy to read and notice the good and the bad from a cash flow statement. 

- Cash flow from operating activities is systematically higher than net income in all of the last 5 years a plus sign that shows us that management isn't aggressive with their revenue recognition over time. 
- Very low CapEx compared to the net income same with depreciation
- Very healthy Free cash flow generation from the businesses.
- Maybe the most important line in the Cash Flow statement in 2012 is in the Cash from Investing Activities segment where we see a 1 491 500$ Retirement of stock along with a 1 354 560$ Issuance of Debt. We now know where the money from the debt went and it was mostly towards an aggressive share buyback program launched in 2012.


Onward with the actual analysis to see if WTW has what it takes to be an investment. *I would like to point out that starting from here many ratios/numbers etc will be estimates or opinions and not facts*.  

A brief summary of the company in itself: 

WTW is a company operating in the Weight loss sector with operations mostly in the US/UK and Canada with the majority of it's revenues comes from the US. Sales come from 3 different sources, in order of importance we have meeting fees, internet revenues and product sales&amp;other. 

Meeting fees are comprised of the actual meeting fees generated when people adhering to the WTW program meet in person to discuss their progression and share tips. The discussion are lead by a sponsor who is paid by WTW ( the structure for paying the sponsors will change in the coming months so I won't elaborate how they are paid). Internet revenues are comprised of adherence by members to the website program and publicity on the websites by third parties.
Product sales and Others wrap up the sales of products that WTW licences and certain joint ventures that they have but are slowly buying back. 


The metrics to calculate revenues from the website of the meetings is called paid weeks which is essentially the amount of weeks paid for each sector. Multiply that number by the pricing per week and you get the meetings revenues for each sector. 


Ok so what's happening in 2013 because the stock price took a dive and hasn't recovered since...It would seem that the QE tide forgot to raise them along the way. 

In short the publicity campaign in January didn't produce the effect that was expected add to that their main spokesperson ( Jessica Simpson) got pregnant and had to drop the contract... Shame but can you blame her husband :S

Since WTW is a very cyclical business the majority of the subscriptions comes in the first quarter of the year after the holiday and a bit more in the spring before summer and bathing suit season  creeps around. Missing one of those is hard for the revenues because you can't simply shove down the throat of the clients that they need to lose weight. They need to have the will to lose weight before you show them the way how to. Essentially guilt after the holidays and the desire to be hot in the summer.

Oh they also kicked the CEO out the door last summer which is the reason for the other stock dive (a positive in my book). 


My estimations for the 2103 fiscal years area as follows. 

- EPS of 3.59$  on revenues of 1 723 490$ 
- Meeting fees of 840 600$ a decrease of 10% 
- Internet revenues of 541 800$ an increase of 7.5% YoY due mainly to the mobile revolution for lack of a better word. Past increases have been in the double digits in the recent years. The high single digits increase is again because of the shit publicity in Q1 and Q2. Management did mention in the last conference call that the retention rate of the website was flat so although they had less people joining, those that did are happy with the program and are staying. All in all online subscribers should fall around 200 000 out of the 2.3 millions they had back in Q2 of 2013. Yup 2.3 millions paying subscribers you guys can correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is one of the highest number of paying subscriptions for a website.
- Total costs of 1 522 300$ thanks to the cost cutting initiative that was implemented earlier this year
-Net income *estimated* of 3.59$ with 56 millions shares outstanding. 
- Profit margins should be around 11% more or less although I don't put too much emphasis on the profit margin for the rest of the year considering the shitty start and the cost cutting initiative. Once the dust settles down I think the numbers will be more meaningful.


**2014**
The positive catalysts for 2014 are many fold but the major ones are good publicity campaigns in January, good consumer confidence, good economic health in the US ( meaning no flat GDP growth).  

- Total sales of 1 683 420$ of which 38% will come from Meeting Fees, 43% from internet revenues and 19% from Others and product sales. 
- Total Costs of revenues of 1 446 190$
- Net income of 237 240% giving us a profit margin of 14%. 
- EPS of 4.23$

So on future EPS and a historical P/E of  15.40 in the last 7 years my price target is of 65$. At the current price of 38$ it is a pretty nice bargain in my opinion. 


This was longer than I initially anticipated... I removed details that I found were not relevant for an initial post but I will gladly any question you might have.

1pydup,[New with Questions],t3_ywlgr,"Hey guys,  
  
I recently got into a career job and find myself making an extra $400-$500 every couple weeks/month.  I've been working here for almost a year, and have just been living it up with the extra money.  I figured it's about time to start investing, rather than just blowing it all the time.  
  
I've read a lot of these posts and beginner guides here, but the lingo and such isn't really clicking.  I guess my real question is, should I look into talking to an investment broker, a financial investor, or just keep on trucking through all of these guides until it makes sense so I can do it myself?  Are sites like E-trade (even though I hate that stupid talking baby) good and worth looking into?  Keep in mind, I'm going to be starting off small (Around $500-$600) starting off.  
  
Any help would be much appreciated!

1q5n5b,New Mod,t3_ywlgr,"Hello, I'm your new mod. Nice to meet you.

I've been asked to come over from a dead subreddit similar to this one to help out a little bit. I actually don't really follow this or the other subreddit much as I don't like paper trading but do frequent /r/investing quite often. 

I have a Bachelors in both accounting and finance with a career mostly tax focused but I'm currently the financial controller for a print shop as well as the bookkeeper for an ATM operator in a major US city. I'm currently reading through a study guide to take the series 65 exam as well as Tap Dancing to Work: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything, 1966-2012.

Some recent trades of mine from the past year have been sell on GSVC, buy on NM, INVN, ATVI and DDD. My portfolio has a weighted beta of 1.68.

I've been working on [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApMI75xEvO_MdFBHMGxJZFZoX1NlYUlqeHM1ZTZjOUE&amp;usp=sharing) to analyze the portfolio a bit and I had a few notes:

* The sidebar states that a position needs to have a market cap greater than $500m yet MBII slipped by with a market cap of $300m. A side comment - Google is showing -$13 EPS but Yahoo finance has it as -$36...
* Not sure what happened with EA but you guys got trigger happy and lost out on  70%+ upside. Hopefully a lesson was learned but if you're going to go through the effort of making the purchase you should stick it out more than a week. 
* All 3 of the sales have been 100% liquidations. Possibly in the future consider maybe selling half, such as the case with TSLA that went up another 50% after deciding that it was overbought.
* The portfolio is quite heavy on large-cap and lacking mid-cap. 
* Also missing are ETFs and short positions.

Any suggestions to the speradsheet are greatly appreciated and I look forward to serving you in the future.

1s758y,[Buy] McDonald's,t3_ywlgr,"After recently doing a DCF model presentation on the company I believe that McDonald's is significantly undervalued and worth looking at. The stock has not done well comparatively the past two years, particularly during the recent market run-up, which I believe has made it a Buy opportunity. Today's labor strike may cause the perfect triggering event to get in at the bottom over the next few days.

In order to justify the current share price, one needs to project *negative* growth year-over-year using the abnormal ROE and abnormal NI methods. In comparison, many other fast food company's you might expect to flock to, like Chipotle, are trading at extreme premiums on these models. This year's EPS estimate for McDonald's by analysts is a 3.5% increase.

MCD shares are currently priced at 17.21x this year’s forecasted earnings, compared to the industry’s 34.09x earnings multiple. 

McDonald's has a history of paying an attractive dividend of almost 3.5%.

The current average price target is $103.62, which is 8.65% above where the stock opened this morning. 

In short this isn't the next Tesla/Solar/Bitcoin explosion, but may be a great low-risk opportunity for growth.",[deleted],InvestmentClub,2013-12-05 23:11:53,13,20,20,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/1s758y/buy_mcdonalds/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/1s758y/buy_mcdonalds/,True,False,0.0,,,,,,

&gt; The thing that stands out to me is that over 40% of the portfolio is in cash. Meanwhile there are multiple positions closed out within the year. This is beyond conservative -- its downright skittish.

&gt; At least dump the cash position in VTI and then sell enough VTI to cover the initiation of a new position.



When one is looking for broad market exposure I think we can all agree that Vanguard is the way to go. The main question would be - is now the time to go long?

For assets like stocks I've become aware of a method of ""selling short"" to borrow and sell shares of a security you don't own and then buy it back at a lower price for a profit.

My question is: is there a way to sell short a quantity of currency (as in FOREX) and buy it back at a different price. Such a transaction could have allowed a person to profit significantly if they could predict the crash of the bitcoin bubble (which seemed very inevitable).

1vcdmk,Found great YouTube videos on a simple and effective strategy for growing (small) accounts.,t3_1vcdmk,"(Thought about posting this here in it's own post after I replied to someone asking for tips on how to get started on a small account.)

Not too long ago I stumbled on [StockTradingMaster](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIgA_dK97QXrirYAfHmW8ZA) on YouTube.

I'll be honest he is a big fan of JB Account Builders, but his technique and strategy actually seem to work.

I'll try to give a brief overview of his strategy.

Basically, his strategy is to watch oversold stock and wait/find a catalyst that will drive the price up.

Personally, I mix his tips with my expanding candlestick pattern knowledge. I wait for reversal signals or bullish patterns. Which can actually be a catalyst themselves at times. 

I think his videos have given me valuable knowledge and I hope it can do the same for other people.

I recommend the videos on his Lessons of Stock Trading playlist.

pretty good article talking about TESLA entering the mass market means TESLA owners will need more charging stations at work / on errands etc. as 35% of people in US don't have ability to charge in a home garage.

CarCharging Inc. is in some financial strains being so young. But the demand for car charging stations is there, I believe. Car Charging Inc. has consolidated the market, acquiring 4 of its competitors.... so, could this be the time to ""get in early"" on this emerging industry?

1wj0o2,"[buy] Blackstone Group, BX",t3_1wj0o2,"If you haven't been following Blackstone's stock then you need to take a look. The price has just about doubled in the last year as Blackstone eats up all the deals that banks now have to pass on.

Just recently Blackstone was able to take a deal that several banks passed on merely because it involved leveraging a company to 6.8x EBITDA versus the max of 6x that banks now face. They made something like 10 million in fees just by taking that .8 extra ""risk"". 

As a non-banking financing institution Blackstone stands to actually gain from some of the regulation that is going to hurt banks. Their massive acquisitions are going to start paying off in the next few years as well.

While I realize I'm not going to deep, I know their financials are solid and they are positioned to seriously profit in the coming years. I would not be shocked seeing Blackstone trading 50+ in the next 2 years.

* Norfolk Southern - NSC Increased their dividend by 3.84% to $0.54/share quarterly after beating Q4 estimates in both EPS and revenue due to strong auto sales and increasing revenue gains in commodity groups. [The Motley Fool](http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/6/2/e/62e12fe6e3ba49bb/Market_Foolery_01_22_2014.mp3?c_id=6715179&amp;expiration=1391358051&amp;hwt=4e408abe55569f239960b28a1e8ee73c) reported on the surprisingly good results and discussed the decline in coal prices and railroad stocks in general. Right at the end of the month the company announced it opened a transfer terminal in Chesapeake, VA to accommodate dry bulk shippers transferring commodities between rail cars and trucks

* Ford Motors - Q4 earnings reported a revenue beat but cited a continuing trend of declining cash flows and shrinking margins. The company also reported that December unit sales were up 1.7% (est was 4.3%) with trucks and utilities selling well as cars lagged. The F-Series sales rose 8.4% to 74,592 while Fusion sales were up 26.6% to 24,408. Taurus, Focus, and Fiesta all saw big drops in sales during the month compared to a year ago. A feather in Ford's cap, the automaker fully expects to end the year as the top selling auto brand in the US. Incentives on average increased by 21.7% over the last year to $3,346 - still well-short of GM’s average December incentive of $3,657. Ford sold 99K vehicles in China during December, a 35% jump from last year's mark. Ford was an out-performer in the UK with its Fiesta and Focus models the two top sellers for 2013. Following months of reports, speculation and debate on 1/7 Alan Mulally stated he wasn't leaving Ford for Microsoft. Ford also increased its dividend 25% to $0.125/share quarterly. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show [a concept car that runs on solar power](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101304906) was on display with Ford saying the sun could provide enough power for 75% of all the trips in a car such as the C-MAX.

Even though steel is cheaper the consumer price point will not change and the trucks should provide better gas mileage. 

* Allergan Inc. - On 1/14 CEO David Pyott gave an [interview](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/allergan-ceo-preps-multibillion-dollar-deal-spree-swell-pipeline/2014-01-14) detailing the company’s thirst for acquisitions. AGN is in a position to spend up to $10 billion in cash for new deals and has a desire to add researchers and make acquisitions this year. Analysts at RBC updated their price targets to represent 14% upside on today’s price while Morgan Stanley updated their price targets to reflect 18% downside on today’s price.



* Schlumberger Ltd. - SLB increased their dividend 28% to $0.40/share quarterly after reporting a better than expected 22% jump in Q4 earnings on strong revenue from drilling activity in the Middle East and Asia. Goldman Sachs, Sterne Agee and analysts at Deutsche Bank all see upside for SLB.

* Orange SA - Orange and Deutsche Telekom canceled plans to take their Everything Everywhere UK mobile JV public. Orange asserts maintaining the current 50/50 JV structure is the ""best option for value creation"". Kepler Capital cut their rating of ORAN to Reduce. 

* Archer Daniel Midlands - On 1/30 [reports came out](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/biofuel-maker-solazyme-up-12-announces-commercial-ops-2014-01-31) that ADM would begin commerical production on renewable Algal Oils for Solazyme (SZYM). Production is expected to hit capacity within 12-18 months, with targeted potential expansion at a multiple of 5 in subsequent years. Truckloads of product are now shipping from the Iowa operations for use in applications including lubricants, metalworking and home and personal care in the US and Brazil.

* SBA Communications - Analysts estimates moved higher as SBAC prepares to report Q4 on 2/25.

* Telecom Indonesia - TLK pushed up 4% in a down month

* Weight Watchers - WTW sank 15%+ during the month of January

* McDonalds - On 1/7 MCD announced that [by 2016 they will begin purchasing their beef from verified sustainable producers](http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/01/07/inside-mcdonalds-quest-sustainable-beef). Wells Fargo downgraded MCD to Market Perform with Moody’s maintaining a Stable outlook while Morgan Stanley lifted their price target to reflect 22% upside on today’s price. Q4 earnings were announced with EPS pretty much in line with a miss on revenue estimates - global sales were flat to growing while domestic sales are slipping. According to [an internal memo Bloomberg got a hold of](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-29/mcdonald-s-seeks-to-out-latte-starbucks-amid-coffee-wars.html) MCD lists increasing coffee-focused visits as a top priority for its 2014-2016 strategy. On 1/19 [KPP financial gave the following professional opinion](http://www.kppfinancial.com/investtalk/radio/should-food-stocks-be-in-your-shopping-cart)
&gt;There is nothing wrong with McDonald’s… The only complaint you can have is that it is so big that its growth is very slow, 2-5%, and that’s all it’s ever going to do… to have a market P/E of 15 that means the stock is worth about $90… You want to buy McDonald’s for the dividend - it pays 3.5%...

1wyhn1,"[buy] PetSmart, PETM (revisited)",t3_1wyhn1,"I thought it might be kind of interesting to give an old stock recommendation a second look 1 year later - particularly PetSmart. Originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/pbesp/petsmart_nasdaqpetm/) it was voted down with a majority. OP /u/bgritzut made some excellent points:

&gt; ..currently trading at 53.77 (market cap of 6B) with a dividend yield of 1.04%. It should be noted that PetSmart has comfortably raised their dividend for the past three years, and the current payout ratio is 22%.

&gt; Revenues and cash flows have been steadily increasing every year. Liquidity should not present a problem with a current ratio of 2. Beta is 0.75 and P/E is 22.

**Today PETM trades around $62-$63 with a yield of 1.2%, a Beta of 0.4 and P/E of 15.64. Even though the stock has gone up from 1 year ago it looks incredibly inexpensive in comparison trading near 52 wk lows with an increased dividend, lower payout ratio at 17%, lower Beta and lower P/E.**

Many of the comments in the original post expressed fear over pet retail and brick-and-mortar stores succumbing to Amazon.com and Costco/Walmart. Ultimately this is PetSmart's biggest risk. The pet industry as a whole is somewhat non-cyclical economically and the big guys know it. 

The catalyst for PetSmart to move forward is to strengthen its moat with pet services such as PetsHotel, grooming/training services and veterinarian services. Banfield Pet Hospitals can be found in only 60% of the PetSmart stores. I've found that Banfield is extremely price competitive in comparison to most veterinarian providers as I had the pleasure of experiencing their business model first hand recently. They also offer pet health plans and have a credit facility through GE Capital.

PetSmart [PETM] is a bit of a value play with a P/S ratio of 0.93. The risks of big box retailers and Amazon (see [The Amazon Effect Quantified study] (http://www.placed.com/resources/white-papers/aisle-to-amazon)) taking away business is already baked into the stock.

1xt576,[Sell] Sell ARMH -- an expensive stock facing competitive headwinds and declining margins,t3_1xt576,"I'd like to propose that the portfolio close its position on ARMH (Arm Holdings). The company reported a net loss of 6.2m pounds in the fourth quarter vs a profit of 42.5m pounds in the prior year. 

Despite shipping over 2.9b ARM-based chipped in the quarter (with revenue up) the company still couldn't eke a profit from its revenue stream (1/2 of which is royalty).

At +20x sales ARMH is priced as a profitable growth stock; yet it is not producing profits. Meanwhile competitors such as INTC (2x sales), Samsung et al are all making a concerted effort to take marketshare from ARMH regardless of profit. Given that these companies own their own fabs, the long term inevitability is that ARMH's margins will decline thus causing major erosion in the stock price.

I see downside within 2013 to $31 if not lower.




ARM Holdings  (ARMH_) reported a net loss of 6.2 million pounds in its fourth quarter, a significant drop from a profit of 42.5 million pounds in the same quarter last year, as the British semiconductor company dealt with one-off charges including payroll taxes and impairments.

The Cambridge-based business saw revenue climb 15% to 189.1 million pounds, beating estimates of 181.8 million pounds. Though 2.9 billion ARM-based chips were shipped over the quarter, demand for chips in premium smartphones tailed off.

The company generates around half its income through royalties on licensed semiconductor designs to customers such as Qualcomm. In the fourth quarter, the company saw 26% year-on-year growth in processor licensing and 7% year-on-year growth in processor royalties.

""ARM's strategy is for our technology to continue to gain share in long-term growth markets, such as smartphones, tablets, enterprise equipment and embedded computing, and to increase the royalty percentage ARM receives from each device,"" said CEO Simon Segars in a statement.

However, I was looking to see if there's a website like those, where I get to set the amount of money that's in my practice portfolio. $100,000 in a practice portfolio just makes me feel like I have no real attachment to the stocks I purchase, and no real risk if something I wanted to purchase with my real money were to tank.

1y0d1l,"Portfolio Advice, securities, index funds, and ira questions",t3_1y0d1l,"I've been on the sidelines for a long time up until a while ago, because of trading restrictions at a former finance related job.  Regardless I was able to build a 401k up to 50,000 in that time, and have rolled that into a traditional IRA, since I have gone full contract worker.

I have 20,000 invested in common stocks.  75% spread out over some blue chips, and now some energy etfs.  Recent purchases included $AAPL, Oil Etf $FILL, etc.  25% is allocated into riskier ventures, $AFOP, pot stocks $PHOT and $FITX

Long on all of this.  I played the penny stocks dips and jumps for a few weeks and made enough cash to basically buy back in and cash out my principle.  However I don't have time to day trade, so those two picks are long picks that I think have a chance to bust or go big.  We will see.

I have two questions. I understand the market well from experience, but I don't know much about the Ira world. 

1.   I got 4000 in a cash account locked from a pension roll over.  I can roll it into my traditional IRA, or start a Roth IRA.  Some advice has been to ignore the current ira and begin building a roth ira.  I however will probably get a fee on that roll over so may start fresh with my own  money for the Roth.

2.  I am looking to also start investing in an index fund.  Most require an initial investment of 2500, and I'd like to slowly invest 10,000$ into that over the course of two years, while maxing out the IRA also.  What are suggestions for an index fund?  I've looked at the Vanguard offerings as well as the ishares and like them.  I'm just overwhelmed with the amount of choices.  I'm looking for something with moderate risk.

Right now I'm 30 and making around 150k a year.  No major debts yet.  Any suggestions appreciated.

1yjoqg,[BUY] Buy JPM. Profit engine to accelerate with lawsuits/one-time costs in decline,t3_1yjoqg,"JP Morgan is an undervalued bank which has been trading below its peer valuation due to a series of ""one-time"" costs starting with the financial crisis. 

This has been totally deserved since the bank has faced unknown (in terms of size) fines from regulators as well as lawsuits from a variety of businesses/stakeholders. It has lost billions from bad trading and been scrutinized by congress for lack of strong controls. 

Through all that -- the bank has managed to remain profitable and currently trades for 9x this year earnings. This compared to competitor Wells Fargo (13x) and the general market (15x). Earnings are expected to accelerate over 2014 with operating costs being reduced and few lawsuits/one-time costs remaining left to deal with. 

On a macro-economic front, as interest rates rise the banks NIM (net interest margin) on its loans should also rise....boosting profit. 

Dividend yield is at 2.6% and will likely be increased every year over the next 2-3 years. Insiders have been acquiring the stock in the mid-50s which indicates management's faith in the banks ability to boost return on tangible common equity from a pedestrian 11% to a lofty 16%.

Buy this bank because its an inflection point -- having come through the financial crisis by dealing with all the mortgage related lawsuits; the company is now able to use its massive size (from all those crisis acquisitions) to create a steady profit stream levered to an improving US economy.

1zcepn,[Sell] Sell Weight Watchers (WTW) -- a diet plan company being replaced by technology,t3_1zcepn,"I'd like to advocate for the portfolio's position in this company to also be closed as a result of there recent earnings call.

Quote from CEO: ""our offerings have become less appealing in this changing market largely because our innovation approach and our approach to the consumer in general have not been sufficiently market driven. In addition, we have a big task at hand to modernize our technology architecture and create a more efficient product development engine.""

In english -- the market no longer wants to buy our products having chosen superior options (fitbit/foodtracking apps etc) and we will have to spend significant capital to develop competing options.

This transforms WTW from a company with an assured market and revenue stream to a speculative investment which is trying to use its existing capital to establish marketshare in a new market.

This is not an IT company, or an app development company. Much like Barnes &amp; Noble with the nook, I don't believe WTW has shown that they have the skillset to pivot in this direction.

On a bit of navel-gazing note, if you reading forums like /r/fitness, you quickly realize that apps like myfitness pal pretty much replace the entire value proposition of weight watchers. This investment should be sold simply on the basis that when it was approved it was never spun as a high risk investment. 

If they have no competitive moat vs 'free apps' that can do the same thing from a smart phone, they are unlikely to make significant revenue growth or maintain profit margins.

2/28/14 holdings value: 761,474

ARMH out, JPM in

* ARM Holdings swung a loss of £6.2M in Q4 from a profit of £42.5M a year earlier, with the microchip designer hurt by one-off charges such as payroll taxes and impairments. Adjusted pretax profit rose 19% to £95.5M and revenues climbed 15% to £189.1M, topping estimates of £181.8M, although growth was limited by slower sales of chips for high-end smartphones. ARM has ""a strong opening order backlog and a healthy pipeline of licensing opportunities,"" and it expects full-year 2014 processor royalty revenues ""to grow at a similar rate to that reported over the last three years."" The company also forecasts overall revenue to be in line with market expectations.

* JPMorgan Chase had its big Investor Day conference and reported that in an effort to cut costs it plans to slash 5,000 jobs this year. It comes on top of 7,000 job losses at the branch level over the past two years. In its presentation JPMorgan unveiled a ""branch of the future,"" in which fewer employees will operate in spaces with less square feet and greater automation. These futuristic branches will have 6 employees, on average, compared with the current average of 9. They will also have fewer tellers and more financial advisers. 

* Archer Daniel Midlands - ADM raised the quarterly dividend 26% as well as reporting a Q4 earnings beat of +10% on declining revenues. ADM said its unadjusted Q4 earnings fell 27% Y/Y largely due to charges relating to its failed acquisition of Australian grain handler GrainCorp., but adjusted EPS of $0.95 beat estimates. Corn processing profit more than doubled to $223M, including a $228M increase in the bioproducts division, which includes ethanol processing; however, ADM faces challenges ahead as the U.S. government considers a reduced ethanol blending mandate that could hit ADM's ethanol business.

* Allergan Inc. - AGN reported Q4 earnings in line and revenues up +14.6% Y/Y but net profits slimming. Total specialty pharmaceuticals net sales +14%, total core medical devices +17%. AGN has been the best portfolio performer of the past 6 mo, 3 mo and near win for Feb.

* Ford Motors - F January sales by brand: Ford -8.4%; Lincoln +42.5%. In the short term Ford put a 4 day production stop on at a plant in Romania to adjust for demand in Europe and in the long term MCD is cutting production by ⅓ in Australia in a continued step toward exiting the region. Sales in China are doing great, up +53% over last year’s level. Germany has been another growth area, up +38% Y/Y. Consumer Reports recently ranked automakers by consumer perception and Ford ranked 2nd behind Toyota and in front of Honda. It was announced that Ford may have to go trial for a third time in a 12-year lawsuit in which dealers have accused the company of breaching an agreement to publish prices for medium and heavy trucks, forcing them to pay more from 1987-1998. In the first trial in 2011, Judge Peter Corrigan told Ford to pay $2B to a class of about 3,000 dealers, but a state appeals court overturned the ruling. Ford won the second trial in September, but Corrigan believes that the jury in that hearing was confused and has ordered a third trial. More bad news as we saw GM accelerating efforts to copy F with an entirely aluminum body. One final piece of news was the increased focus from automakers on discounting in order to drive traffic to showrooms.

* Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc - MBII sank again this month - another 8.75% but things may be turning around as they may have hit a bottom, according to Piper Jaffrey.

* McDonald’s - MCD reports profit fell by close to 50% in 2013 in Japan as same-store sales dropped 6.2% for the full year. They plan to reduce store count by 2.3%. Global comps rose 1.2% in January with a geographic breakdown of Europe +2%; U.S. -3.3%; APMEA +5.4%.
We also saw a challenge from Taco Bell as they rolled out a breakfast option beginning in late March. MCD currently has about +30% morning market share and is currently considering longer breakfast hours due to strong demand. Another thorn in MCD’s side is the minimum wage debate, which we saw the Gap stirred the pot by raising their minimum wage and legislators meet to discuss getting minimum wage up to $10.10.

* Norfolk Southern - On 2/13 a Norfolk Southern train carrying heavy Canadian crude oil derailed and spilled in western Pennsylvania. 19 derailed cars were carrying oil, 4 of which spilled 3K-4K gallons of oil, and 2 derailed cars held liquefied petroleum gas.

* Orange SA - ORAN has confirmed it's talking to Microsoft about a partnership revolving around video site/would-be YouTube rival Dailymotion. The French carrier, which has been looking for international partners to grow Dailymotion's reach, says it will hold onto its majority stake in the site in the event of a deal. Last year, the French government blocked ORAN from selling Dailymotion to Yahoo. Though Microsoft's Bing contains a video site, it doesn't currently support uploads. It was also reported that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook met with top mobile carrier execs, including those of Vodafone and Orange, to address concerns carriers are being reduced to ""dumb pipes"" as services such as Facebook and WhatsApp proliferate, and in doing so eat into voice/SMS revenue. Zuck is looking to enlist carriers such as Vodafone and Orange in its Internet.org initiative to provide free access to basic Web services in emerging markets. The Vodaphone CEO said offering free Facebook access to Vodafone subs ""does not make any sense"" for the carrier.

* SBA Communications - SBAC reported Q4 EPS of -$0.15 (miss by $0.09) but revenues up +14.1% Y/Y. SBAC is one the portfolio’s top performers over the past 1 yr and 3 mo.

* Schlumberger Ltd. - On Friday Barron’s wrote that despite a bright outlook the company may still be undervalued by as much as 28% as global demand for oil continues to grow. “Increasingly reserves are located in areas that are hard to drill, a long-term boon for SLB's leading technologies; in the nearer term, big oil companies will spend more money in 2014 than in 2013 on SLB's services, and SLB continues to progress with its efficiency and reliability initiatives.”

* Telecom Indonesia - TLK pushed up 7.5% - nearly double the SPY

* Total -TOT sold 15% of its stake in an offshore Angola oil block in addition to a 10% stake in Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz II gas field. TOT found oil in the North Sea and announced that it’d be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on exploration in South Africa.The company also reported Q4 with net profits slipping 19% and revenues down 4%.

* Weight Watchers - WTW  reported disappointing Q4 results with an 11.5% miss on EPS guidance on revenues declining 11% Y/Y. CEO Jim Chambers said ""2014 will be a very challenging year as reflected in our 2014 EPS guidance"" down 18.75%. The stock tumbled 26% that day and month-over-month has lost 22%.

20305a,[BUY] Wi-Lan (NASDAQ:WILN; TSX:WIN),t3_20305a,"**Portfolio Considerations**


The current portfolio lacks exposure to the technology sector and small-cap equities (although the later may be considered a positive depending on one's current situation and goals).


**Macro Considerations**


It is a clear trend that the world is becoming more and more interconnected through technology. Devices such as smart-phones and tablets are projected to grow annually between 30-45% over the next 5 years.


**Company**


WiLan is engaged in the business of licensing intellectual property with over 275 businesses, including familiar names such as: Cisco, Samsung and Nokia. Wilan's IP portfolio has over 4000 patents that covers mobile devices, consumer electronics, wi-fi, routers, bluetooth, etc. In 2013, the top 10 licenses accounted for 79% of revenues (down from 83% in the previous year).The underlying business is a high margin, high growth model as there is not much expenses associated with collecting money.


WiLan currently trades just over $3.00 (USD) with a market cap of just over $400M. It's current ratio is 3.2, forward P/E is 8.4 (5 year historical average is 17.6), P/S is 4.2 (5 year historical average is 7.8), LT-Debt/Equity is 0.13 and 3-year beta is 0.45. It pays a dividend and currently yields 4.7%. Revenues have a CAGR of 27% since 2008.


WiLan has finally settled litigations which have caused it's stock to drop over the past 2 years and the numbers from the latest quarter are encouraging.


**Risks**


* Due to the nature of the business, litigation remains the biggest risk. WiLan was negatively impacted by large litigation expenses over the past year

* Laws - Change to patent laws

* FX - Foreign exchange risk

**Sell Target**


Given the business model, I wouldn't put a sell price target but I would reevaluate the hold/sell thesis when it hits $4.00 (USD) or by year-end, whichever comes first.

205bge,[BUY] Canadian Natural Resources -- a cheap oil producer with potential upside from geopolitics,t3_205bge,"CNQ is a canadian producer of oil trading a peg of .6, with dividends of 2%. Cash flow from operations (a typical way to look at oil companies) is near $7/share with the cash flow currently being used to expand production. The company expects to grow cash flow by 45% /annum over the next 6 years.

Revenue is expected to increase by at least 15% in 2014. CNQ at $37 trades at 12x forward earnings, and 5x operating cash flow. This compared to XOM which trades at 12.48 forward pe and 10x operating cash flow. So its cheap (on a cash flow basis) but not a stunning bargain on the surface.

So where is the opportunity? Well 50% of CNQ's oil production is currently 'trapped' in Canada and unable to be effectively transported to refineries (in Texas). As a result, CNQ oil currently gets sold for $30-40/less per barrel than the US crude oil price (west texas intermediate). 

IF CNQ can get its oil to Texas' refineries (or Canada builds its own refineries -- unlikely but possibly), CNQ would see a huge impact on its operating profit margin. 

For this to happen, the President of the USA needs to approve the Keystone pipeline which would connect existing pipeline infrastructure in the USA, to Canada's pipeline system. For a variety of political/environmental reasons, the president has been delaying making a decision on the pipeline for several years. However circumstances in the Ukraine might have created a tipping point whereby it becomes in the strategic security interest of the USA to lower the price of oil. The logic here goes: approve the pipeline, lower the price of oil, knock Russia's economy into a deep recession due to them relying on oil prices &gt; $100/barrel. 

The reasons not to approve the pipeline primarily comes to environmental concerns -- the idea that more oil production would irreparably contribute to global warming. If the pipeline decision is negative, then CNQ should return decent, yet constrained profits as it expands its production. Any positive approval however will act as a massive boost to earnings and allow it to both expand its production while paying down its admittedly high debt levels.

I'm pitching this as a heads you win small, tails you win massive play.

22iybq,[Buy] Freeport Copper -- copper is at a bottom and deepwater results will start showing results this summer.,t3_22iybq,"Freeport Copper is a company run by...well to avoid slander lets say management keeps an eye on their personal bottomline. In the past two years it has taken on substantial debt to acquire a failing oil company (McMoran) at a premium price, and managed to get itself ensared in a political fight with the government of Indonesia over its processing of copper.

The amount of capital destruction the company has accomplished could only be exceeded if they were to shovel cash into a giant whirlpool in the gulf of Mexico. And yet....

At the end of the day FCX still has solid producing mining assets capable of addressing its debt, and a viable option on making major profit from its deepwater oil/gas assets. Why buy now? Because after all the insider self dealing, and massive debt loading the company stands at an inflection point.

There are two main drivers of revenue for FCX -- copper and oil/gas. Copper is the present paycheck, oil/gas is the future lottery ticket.

Copper prices in the past few months have crashed to the point where arguably at $3/pound, its at a bottom. A bet on copper stabilizing here is essentially a call on China managing to not head into a market crash scenario. The company's mines produce copper well below the $3/pound level (even more so when you factor in the gold also produced) so the risk to its copper production is not so much selling at a loss but solving its Indonesia problem. This problem being that the government of Indonesia wants to force local mining companies to smelt their mined ore in Indonesia -- this would involve building smelters at huge capital expenditure.  FCX is threatening to shut down the mines if Indonesia breaks their contract with the company and Indonesia is threatening to levy a 60% tax on ore not smelted there. Given elections are later this year -- a lot of the threat (on both sides) is political, but at the end of the day its extremely unlikely for Indonesia to sacrifice their largest tax revenue base in order to further the goal of developing the Indonesian economy. Thesis 1: The Indonesian problem will be solved beneficially to FCX (local miners highly likely to get screwed).

Which brings up the deepwater drilling program -- when FCX bought McMoran (and Plains Exploration) 2 years ago, McMoran was teetering on bankruptcy due to what can be charitably called a failed drilling program. Much like a monkey who can't get his hand out of a jar, McMoran had spent so much money trying to extract its reserves -- they went bust when their drill program failed to achieve success. Two years later -- FCX currently has little to show for its deepwater acquisition, but hints from insider buying suggest that this major catalyst is about to change. Remember I talked about management being interested in their own bottomline? Well many of those same people who benefited immensely from the acquisition of McMoran by FCX (they sat on the board of McMoran) used the McMoran profits and have bought shares of FCX right around the current trading price. This to me is an indicator of thesis 2: FCX has finally gained traction on its deepwater drilling program and will be ramping production as soon as this summer. If so, the beneficial cash flow of the McMoran acquistion will finally start paying significant benefits to shareholders.


On a valuation basis, FCX is a bit tricky -- their PEG ratio is an obscenely cheap .35 and earnings growth over the next 5 years is slated to be around 28% per annum. As a kicker, you get a dividend yield of near 4% as well. So its cheap-- especially after dropping around 15% ytd. Quarterly revenue is growing, and compared to classic mining competitors like Newmont Mining and Souther Copper, its a steal. The risks here are A) untrustworthy management B) a world economic pullback reducing the demand for copper particularly in China and C) further delays in extracting the ""McMoran"" reserves. 

At current prices, the margin of safety in a FCX investment suggests a very high return over the next few years -- however if any of the above risk factors trigger, the stock will likely trend lower -- bolstered from collapse by its dividend yield.

23zgf7,[BUY] Renaissance Re (NYSE: RNR),t3_23zgf7,"Renaissance Re is a Bermuda based reinsurer whose business lines includes: property catastrophe reinsurance, specialty reinsurance, Lloyd's syndicate, and Ventures

RNR has a market cap of 4.4 Billion and has a modest dividend yield of 1.1%. We compare selected metrics against 7 other reinsurers in the table below. All competitors are of a similar size (with market caps ranging from 2 Billion to 8 Billion) operating in a similar environment.

| Company | Ticker | Mkt Cap | Div Yield| Beta | Fwd P/E | EV/EBITDA | P/B | Net Margin | ROE | Cmb Ratio |
|:-----------|:------------|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|
| Allied World Assur. | AWH | 3.6 | 1.8 | 0.70 | 13.9 | 8.5 | 1.0 | 17.6 | 12.1| 77.7
| Arch Capital | ACGL | 7.7 | 0.0 | 0.69 | 15.8 | 12.9 | 1.4 | 19.5 | 12.2 | 69.8
| Aspen Insurance | AHL | 3.0 | 1.8 | 0.79 | 11.7 | 9.6 | 0.9 | 13.6 | 10.0 | 84.0
| Axis Capital | AXS | 5.2 | 2.3 | 0.81 | 9.8 | 8.8 | 1.0 | 16.3 | 11.7 | 80.4
| Everest Re | RE | 7.5 | 1.9 | 0.76 | 8.3 | 5.2 | 1.1 | 22.3 | 18.1 | 80.8
| Montpelier Re | MRH | 1.5 | 1.6 | 0.83 | 10.0 | 9.2 | 1.0 | 23.8 | 11.6 | 65.4
| Renaissance Re | RNR | 4.4 | 1.1 | 0.65 | 10.3 | 5.7 | 1.2 | 44.5 | 17.0 | 41.0
| White Mountain Ins. | WTM | 3.7 | 0.2 | 0.62 | 22.2 | 12.7 | 0.9 | 13.3 | 8.2 | 79.7

We can see from table above that overall, the companies do not deviate from the average by much on most of the metrics. For reinsurers, I would particularly focus on P/B and the last 3 metrics in the table. RNR's P/B of 1.2 not among the best in the peer group, but is around industry average. However, it's net margin is an astounding 44.5%, by far the highest among its peers, ROE is 17% which is very high compared to most of the other peers, and an incredible combined ratio of 41%.

Combined Ratio is for [2013 1H - download link is pdf](http://www.intelligentinsurer.com/media/project_ii/document/fitch-global-reinsurance-guide-2014-with-links.pdf); average for universe is 85.9. We can see that RNR seeks out to write very high quality business. For reference, direct insurers generally have combined ratios in the [90's](http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/02/10/319971.htm).

We also note the following about Renaissance Re

* Credit rating is A+ as rated by AM Best.

* Strong history of share repurchases

* Average ROE since 1996 is 21%

* US &amp; Caribbean market accounts for 60% of the company's written premium

* In 2013, opened a branch in Singapore to target growth in Asia, a market expected to exhibit strong growth in the insurance market

* Renaissance has shown conservative reserve practices as illustrated in their [2013 annual report (PDF)](http://www.renre.com/pdf/RENAISSANCERE-FinancialReport2013.pdf), page 46. This is important to note as a major risk when investing in insurers is that management has been too aggressive in their reserve accounting

* Renaissance invests their float primarily in high quality fixed income assets as illustrated in the table below

* [Global market for insurance is expected to grow briskly into the foreseeable future](http://www.munichre.com/en/media-relations/publications/press-releases/2013/2013-05-16-press-release/index.html)

| Investment | % | 
|:-----------|------------:|
| US Treasuries | 19.8 
| Corporate | 26.4
| Other | 24.7
| **Total Fixed Income** | **70.9**
| Short term, Equity &amp; Other | 27.5
| Investments in other ventures | 1.6
| **Total** | **100**

As mentioned earlier, Renaissance consistently reports very strong combined ratios:

| Year | Combined Ratio | 
|:-----------|------------:|
| 2013 | 43.8%
| 2012 | 57.8%
| 2011 | 118.6%
| 2010 | 45.1%
| 2009 | 21.2%

We note that in 2011, Renaissance was impacted by the Tohoku earthquake, New Zealand earthquake and Thailand flooding

Renaissance Re is an attractively priced and well managed reinsurer that I would expect to yield 7-8% annually including dividends. Compared to other reinsurers, it's focus on writing high quality business to generate that extremely low combined ratio would limit its growth slightly however, their foray into the Asian market should help and their revenues as a Lloyd's syndicate has also been growing substantially illustrating that Renaissance has been able to generate revenues from multiple channels.

Major risks include catastrophes, however, I view this as a benefit as catastrophes are not expected to be correlated with the markets.

* Sell if it hits $125 by year end.

In conclusion, Renaissance Re is an attractively priced reinsurer that makes a good fit for investors looking to buy something in the financial sector. It has a strong management team with a history of reporting high ROE and writes high quality business as illustrated by its low combined ratio.

264qlk,[BUY] JE on the TSE. Just energy is a beaten energy/utility Canadian stock that has a 13% dividend.,t3_264qlk,"Hello from Canada. I am a huge fan of the kind of discussion that takes place on this subreddit and I would like to pitch this one.

I hold a portfolio in my TFSA and day trade using margin power as a hobby, so my style is to mix long term investing ideas with technical analysis; that is to say, I trade for the long term while timing the market. I haven't had much luck posting to r/investing since they are very against day trading and market timing there, but I hope you appreciate this one.

Just Energy has a 900+ market cap, PE of 4-5, and is trading at between 6-7 dollars at the moment. Prior to the downgrades by analyst, it was trading around 8-9, with a PE of 6-7.

I believe that the reason for the massive drop is fear - mostly from institutions. This stock was owned by many investors who were seeking a high dividend with relatively safe assets and revenue. JE sells to residential and commercial at long-term fixed prices, which allows it to maintain and increase its dividend since 2011.

At this point, I see 2 possibilities.

1. The dividend cannot be maintained, deteriorates the market cap, and the stock will slowly drop to a sub-penny stock, and in a few years, it may reverse split to make it look more attractive to investors, only to chase investors away. However, those who stayed in the rough times would be awarded with about 4-5% net gain, when taken into consideration the massive yield.

2. The price drops to a point that is attractive to new investors and institutions, which buys up the cheap shares at low daily RSI (6-7), and an incredibly bullish SSTO and MACD setup, see their investment bounce to a reasonably level, with a very small decrease in dividend payout.

In both scenarios, JE will have slow growth, which, according to TD, is due to ""deteriorating net customer adds, margins, and growth rates"".

Over the last week, JE has shed 25%.

Have a look at the chart and on their books and see if you see what I see. I do not recommending buying this stock trying to find a bottom, but I would recommend buying it on the way up using technical analysis. Obviously, this isn't how this subreddit works, so I would just recommend buying it overall.

I didn't spend too much time on this one, so any criticism is most welcome.

EDIT: I bought in today (Thursday) hoping for a short squeeze before the weekend. The short interest is very high at the moment, and I do believe the worst has passed.",shaozhen,InvestmentClub,2014-05-21 16:40:38,13,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/264qlk/buy_je_on_the_tse_just_energy_is_a_beaten/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/264qlk/buy_je_on_the_tse_just_energy_is_a_beaten/,True,False,0.0,,,,,,

27yh2c,"[BUY] VNQ for optimal hedging and growth. We have no exposure to REITs, which are weakly correlated with the overall market while outperforming it long. They work for a low and also rising interest rate environment, and VNQ is one of the biggest, most liquid, cheapest options in this ETF space.",t3_27yh2c,"I've read a lot of brilliantly reasoned, lengthy proposals on this sub that have garnered little attention of late. So, I'll keep each point short and punchy and usually bulleted:

* As an asset class, REITs are weakly correlated with the overall equities market, cf.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2014/01/07/reits-and-your-portfolio/

* REITs are a great option for a low interest rate environment like ours, cf. http://learningprotection.com/invest-money-low-interest-rate-environment/

* REITs can ironically serve as an effective contrarian play when interest rates rise, just like ours are cf. http://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanrolph/2014/01/16/reits-a-contrarian-play/

* The biggest risk with investing in REITs is that they are typically more volatile than larger cap stock; moreover, mortgage / residential REITs are subject to the vagaries of the housing market while serving essentially as a type of bond investment rather than a real estate investment like equity REITS focused on specialized or retail or office contexts. The simplest way to address this is through a well priced, nicely diverse ETF--particularly one minimizing the influence of mortgage REITs in favor of equity (and possibly hybrid) REITs.

VNQ fulfills all the criteria we want: 

* It's the largest REIT ETF in its space with a market cap of $23.55B; this makes it easy to buy and sell whenever we want to do that and also less volatile than investing in individual REIT companies, cf http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&amp;s=VNQ

* It tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, which covers about two-thirds of the value of the entire U.S. REIT market with highest allocation to specialized REITs (30.8%) followed by retail REITs (26.7%) and finally residential REITs (16.2%). This gives us a low expense ratio with the sort of balance we want all in one shot, cf. http://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-excellent-reit-etfs-you-should-not-ignore-etf-news-and-commentary-cm239671

* It is particularly weakly correlated with the overall stock market, cf. http://www.macroaxis.com/invest/market/VNQ--compareProfile--%5EGSPC

* It's priced to sell right now, [sitting in a 5 day dip](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VNQ+Interactive#symbol=VNQ;range=5d) amidst [a very strong 3 month and YTD showing](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VNQ+Interactive#symbol=VNQ;range=5d) after this asset class cooled off as a whole across 2013.

* Bonds would normally be an attractive way to ride out a potential market correction along with our dividend stock, but not with rising interest rates. This REIT ETF presents a third way that is a much better hedge than sitting on 40%+ cash in our portfolio if we're sticking with primarily long positions since REITs not only outperform the general market long but also recover from market downturns faster, cf. http://www.bankrate.com/finance/investing/investing-in-reits.aspx

Bonus:

* [David ""Yale Endowment"" Swenson digs REITS like the ones to which VNQ provides exposure](http://seekingalpha.com/article/531591-swensens-6-etf-portfolio). And he is [one sexy beast of an institutional investor](http://web.invest.yale.edu/dave-media/BNN/Endowed1.jpg).

* Oh but hey, [Bill ""The Coffee House Investor"" Schultheis also knows what's up with REITs](http://www.coffeehouseinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/The-Awesome-Portfolio-Checklist-8x11.pdf). This strategy works for the little guy (in Bill's case, a former trader cum author cum fee only financial advisor [who claims to not remember the last time he even picked an individual stock](http://www.coffeehouseinvestor.com/2013/04/the-awesome-portfolio-checklist/)) and not just the wicked smart and deep pocketed.

**Conclusion: Buy the shit out of VNQ. One could argue that REITs should comprise between 10% and 20% of the total portfolio [if we follow Ralph Block](http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2011/02/08/how-much-of-your-portfolio-should-you-put-into-rei.aspx) or Swenson or Schultheis or pretty much anybody else who is well apprised of this asset class. It's the perfect hedge for our conditions while simultaneously working great as a long term play.**",justjacobmusic,InvestmentClub,2014-06-12 11:51:09,5,16,16,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/27yh2c/buy_vnq_for_optimal_hedging_and_growth_we_have_no/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/27yh2c/buy_vnq_for_optimal_hedging_and_growth_we_have_no/,True,False,0.0,,,,,,

28h0je,"[discussion] Thoughts on AMBA, purchasing prior to GoPro IPO",t3_28h0je,"I recently bought a few shares of Ambarella Inc. (AMBA) 


Info about the company: ""Ambarella, Inc. develops semiconductor processing solutions for video that enable high-definition (HD) video capture, sharing, and display worldwide. The companys system-on-a-chip designs integrated HD video processing, image processing, audio processing, and system functions onto a single chip for delivering video and image quality, differentiated functionality, and low power consumption. Its solutions enable the creation of video content for wearable sports cameras, automotive aftermarket cameras, Internet Protocol (IP) security cameras, and camcorders in the camera market; and manage IP video traffic, broadcast encoding, transcoding, and IP video delivery applications in the infrastructure market. The company sells its solutions to original design manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers through its direct sales force and logistics providers. Ambarella, Inc. was founded in 2004 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.""

Ambarella is a key component of the GoPro ""wearable technology"" cameras. I'm sure y'all are all familiar with GoPros as they have become a new trend. GoPro is set to go public on June 26 I believe. In GoPro's IPO prospectus they stated ""In particular, we incorporate video compression and image processing semiconductors from one provider, Ambarella, Inc., into all of our cameras, and we do not have an alternative supplier for these key components. If Ambarella stopped supplying components on acceptable terms, or at all, or we experienced delays in receipt of components from Ambarella, we would experience a significant disruption in our ability to produce our products, and our business would be materially and adversely affected."" Ambarella also designs technology for a Google wearable camera device. Ambarella can almost be considered the Intel of wearable cameras. They are also a leading supplier for security cameras, television broadcasting, and automobiles. 

AMBA shares are currently trading around $28.50. From Q4 of FY 2013 to Q4 of 2014 revenue increased by almost 27% to $40M. For the full year of 2014 revenue was up to $157.6M, which was 30% higher than 2013.

We approached this issue from a completely different perspective and came up with a method that utilizes laws of physics to determine if any financial instrument is in a buying or selling state, and if so, it pinpoints exact entry and exit prices.

2e7gbd,[Discussion] Large Cash Position In Portfolio,t3_2e7gbd,"Greetings,

Not entirely sure what the risk profile is for this type of investment portfolio, but I think that the large cash position is hurting gains, and should be invested in companies that will outperform the market over the next couple years.

I think a very safe dividend stock (T, JNJ etc) would really increase the returns. 

Thoughts? Comments? Ideas? I could go on with more stocks I think would be good for the portfolio, but I know there's a voting system in use here so I'll save that for another topic.

2jgyb9,TD bank (Canada),t3_2jgyb9,"Currently the canadian market has underwent its correction. although there is speculation that the market will continue to drop, i would consider TD bank to be my top pick. here are my reasons why.

 - Oil and Gold went down and though there is correlation to financials, banks continue their transactions. TD is more customer based and owns 10% of CIBC.

 - current P/E is 11-12. this is due to the large sell off of index funds. as other sectors fell, i believe this sector is a good bet and has been oversold

 - TD has banking in the US. Royalbank is more into capital markets which has suffered lately. royal has underperformed lately as TD has outperformed. Scotia is the most international canadian bank with the poorest performance in my opinion. BMO is in the middle.

 - kevin o'leary spoke very highly of TD bank saying ""it is better run then the canadian government""

There maybe a time for RBC during a recovery stage after elections but right now, it seems to be struggling and lagging behind while other catch up to the largest canadian bank.

2kpozn,"[BUY] UGA - United States Gasoline Fund, LP",t3_2kpozn,"This could also be substituted for USO. But my idea is that right now oil is really low.

OPEC even says that it will bounce back naturally and that they do not need to change output.

2lp8o7,[BUY] USO - United States Oil Fund,t3_2lp8o7,I already tried this with UGA - United States Oil Fund. I was disqualified because the market cap was not big enough. USO is big enough. But my idea is that right now oil is really low. The assumtion and the risk is that oil is typically cyclical. Generally fluctuates between $80 and $110. This would be a quick Buy and Sell turn around. Oil is looking for a turn around. OPEC even says that it will bounce back naturally and that they do not need to change output. http://online.wsj.com/articles/opec-chief-says-lower-oil-price-to-dent-tight-oil-output-1414580640 Also as oil gets lower it becomes unprofitable for fracking companies to make a profit selling so they will build reserves until supply and demand pushes the price back up. Lets make our 20% by summer and get out before it drops again. Oil is below $80 a barrel.,grissij,InvestmentClub,2014-11-08 20:13:15,14,0,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/2lp8o7/buy_uso_united_states_oil_fund/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/2lp8o7/buy_uso_united_states_oil_fund/,True,False,0.0,,,,,,
2lsas9,"Hello guys, could you give some advice for a friend's assignment (tracking securities)?",t3_2lsas9,"Hello r/InvestmentClub, I hope this is the right subreddit to ask for help. So a good friend of mine will not be able to do his assignment for an Investment Course (personal reasons) and has asked me to help him, and the due date is tomorrow. 

This is what he told me: ""there is an assignment about selecting a specific asset mix. So the assignment is about tracking securities for five years and figure out the growth, income and risk rates"".

Please, it would mean a lot if someone could help him since I know little about finance.

Thanks :)",xboraxe,InvestmentClub,2014-11-09 19:24:55,4,0,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/2lsas9/hello_guys_could_you_give_some_advice_for_a/,/r/InvestmentClub/comments/2lsas9/hello_guys_could_you_give_some_advice_for_a/,True,False,0.0,,,,,,
