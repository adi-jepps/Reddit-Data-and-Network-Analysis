This or a similar incident could happen at any time and destroy the share price. Secondly the research you quote is having real effects in the market, pets are now part of a family and treated as such. There is definitely a feeling among a lot of people that chain stores are not the place to take their precious animal, it deserves the attention of a boutique. Boutiques are, correctly or not, seen as having a better understanding, experience, and level of service. Staff are not minimum wage slaves but usually knowledgeable animal lovers.  There will be a place for low cost retail products and service but the (UK) market has everything else covered, there is no way I see a large chain sore capturing much of the market, and the growth they see I put down to the growth of the sector as whole.

* Page 12: Pet services have been growing steadily which is something that cannot be bought online.

* Page 40: Continual capital expenditures to grow PetsHotel, and IT systems.

Management seems to be well aware of the potential threats and are actively investing in the firm.

Once again, I agree services amazon provide another channel for pet owners to do their shopping, but people will still shop at PETM. Amazon sells products in many industries yet companies in those industries still exist because they adapt and alter their strategy to compete. Amazon and Costco are also non pet-specialty stores. Thus, while there may be increased competition, I do not believe it is as devastating as you make it out to be.

Note: I am not a pet-owner, but have frequently visited PetSmart and other pet stores due to friendships with other pet owners, thus I am looking at PETM as an objective observer.",bgritzut,InvestmentClub,05-02-2012 19:18,3,3,0,t3_pbesp,t1_c3o4hpw,,,0,0

I understand where you are coming from, but that type of comparison can be made for any firm.

Among the least expensive pet foods we found were Costco's Kirkland Signature, **PetSmart's Grreat Choice**, Safeway's store brand, and Walmart's Ol' Roy.

With respect to your other comment about preferences for boutique stores. I have no statistics, but from personal experience and anecdotes, I have had employees at other pet stores (i.e., petcetera)  recommend boutique stores they have worked at in the past (when their manager was not around), but with PetSmart, I have always found the employees to be knowledgeable and professional (again, purely anecdotal and I am sure experiences will vary). It should also be noted that of the 47 000 employees, 22 000 are full time, PETM is not subject to collective bargaining agreements and PETM has never experienced a work stoppage (Annual report, page 13).

c3p8wlh,"""Upvotes or nothing"" system?

An investment club must put there minds together to create knowledge that will be smarter than the market. There are a couple things that are wrong with the ""Upvote only system"" and frankly the ""upvote post to pick which stocks to buy"" system in general.


Anyone can come to this, *know nothing about stocks* and just upvote a post. And Reddit has a history of upvoting random things. Some of these people will know nothing about that company and just upvote it. Stuff may sound good to people, but it may not be the factual case. Instead of choosing to buy a stock from the number of upvotes, there should be a more organized way.

There should be alot of discussion about the company before it is purchased, where /investmentclub members will debate, discuss, and question the company's value and future performance. People that would ""upvote"" such company, should have to explain themselves. On the contrary, people that want to avoid such investment would have to explain why they think this stock will under perform. 

I did some research on investment clubs, and this is how *real* ones operate. They work as a team, unlike how the ""upvote"" system would, it would be a ""organized mess"" if you will. I understand that it is different online and more difficult to collaborate but there are still other methods than this.

I talked to you about having some sort of ""Board of directors"" that would look over a stock post and the discussion below and all decide on whether it should be bought or not but you didn't agree. I personally think it would work out good, giving everyone a role yet still having leadership.

 Another method could be a more sophisticated vote system, where one *must* explain whether he wants to go forth and purchase the stock, or whether he thinks it's a bad idea. Majority wins. I am sure you (or even I will help) set up some 3rd party system where we can do this. We might be able to even think of a method of doing this on Reddit or something. 

Take a minute and pretend you put $100,000 in this. Would you want it to be run this way? People who may know nothing investing, up voting a stock that you think will do terrible? You comment but it just stays at the bottom while the post gets upvotes and your comment stays unheard. Wouldn't you want to discuss with the people who are going to vote, on what they like about it, while you tell them what you *don't*?


**td;dr Investment Club's ""upvote or nothing"" system doesn't work out too well, unorganized and doesn't show collaboration. There are some other good ways for this too work and I am willing to help and put forth effort to come up with a system to  turn this into a successful, collaborative and leadership driven Virtual Investment Club that manages a high return portfolio.**

&gt;An investment club must put there minds together to create knowledge that will be smarter than the market. There are a couple things that are wrong with the ""Upvote only system"" and frankly the ""upvote post to pick which stocks to buy"" system in general.

The reason for the upvote only policy is that downvotes seem to enable reddit's vote ""estimation"" system, which means that reddit does not display the true point values for posts, in an effort to thwart ""fake"" voting. It is not, in any way, meant to discourage discussions about why a stock recommendation is a bad idea.

You're right that any newb can upvote whatever he wants without (adequate) forethought but that's a risk I'm willing to take. And I also have faith in the reddit hivemind to question, if not outright discourage, foolish votes. 

&gt;There should be alot of discussion about the company before it is purchased, where /investmentclub members will debate, discuss, and question the company's value and future performance. People that would ""upvote"" such company, should have to explain themselves. On the contrary, people that want to avoid such investment would have to explain why they think this stock will under perform.

Of course you're right that there should be a lot of debate about a company before voting on it. Perhaps I haven't done enough to encourage debate but I can't force people to engage in discussions.

&gt;I did some research on investment clubs, and this is how real ones operate. They work as a team, unlike how the ""upvote"" system would, it would be a ""organized mess"" if you will. I understand that it is different online and more difficult to collaborate but there are still other methods than this.

&gt;I talked to you about having some sort of ""Board of directors"" that would look over a stock post and the discussion below and all decide on whether it should be bought or not but you didn't agree. I personally think it would work out good, giving everyone a role yet still having leadership.

Yes, we talked about having a Board of Directors which I didn't agree to. As I said before, I have faith in the reddit hivemind.

&gt;Another method could be a more sophisticated vote system, where one must explain whether he wants to go forth and purchase the stock, or whether he thinks it's a bad idea. Majority wins. I am sure you (or even I will help) set up some 3rd party system where we can do this. We might be able to even think of a method of doing this on Reddit or something.

I'm not sure what you mean here. However, this subreddit is only 6 days old, so I'd appreciate some time to work some kinks out before we try something new.

&gt;Take a minute and pretend you put $100,000 in this. Would you want it to be run this way? People who may know nothing investing, up voting a stock that you think will do terrible? You comment but it just stays at the bottom while the post gets upvotes and your comment stays unheard. Wouldn't you want to discuss with the people who are going to vote, on what they like about it, while you tell them what you don't?

You're right that this subreddit could be run better. Maybe I can pick up more slack. Maybe I can do more to influence people to participate more. Maybe the current voting system is a bad idea. Whatever you decide to do, please give me some time to work the kinks out. Again, this reddit is only 6 or 7 days old. I know you want this reddit to succeed as much as I do and I appreciate your input. So thanks, and let's see what happens...",Zurevu,InvestmentClub,09-02-2012 00:09,-1,-1,0,t3_pgfbh,t1_c3p8wlh,,,0,0

EDIT: Didn't finish my thought completely...  Along the lines of gasoline becoming so expensive, I think we will see a strong interest and investment in natgas vehicles.  They are already out there in smaller numbers, but I think we will pass $4 gas this year and will not see sub $4 gas after 2012 unless something major changes.

I see what your saying about the comparison to Apple, but Tesla has large touch screen control panels in their cars which elon musk claims the model x will have a better display than the macbook pros. Tesla could slowly move into other markets whether it be their in car computer technology or battery technology.

The batteries were stated to only loose some efficiency over years of use. You also don't have to pay the avg $5,000 a year to fill up your car with gasoline.

Compare that to other massive growth companies -AMZN 2X, Zillow 14X, GRPN 8.75X, NFLX 2.2X, BIDU ~11X- 16 times revenue is pretty ridiculous for a company that isn't even making money.

Thailand flooding or Japanese earthquakes happen. It is incredibly hard, and incredibly risky to predict where things are going to end up. You have to take this into account, and make smart, risk managed trades to ensure you don't lose your damn shirt.

I have nothing against Tesla as a company, I just think that the stock is too risky to throw money at right now.

Also, your math is clearly way way off.
&gt;a little over 10,000 to be profitable they are projecting to sell at least 20,000 in 2012.

If they only need to sell 10k cars t be profitable, and you believe that they are going to sell 20k in 2012, then you believe they will be profitable in 2012. This contradicts your statement that they aren't going to be profitable until 2013.

Falling in love with a company is and ignoring the downside risks is a common mistake that newcomers to the stock market make. It seems to me that this is the case here.",hedgefundaspirations,InvestmentClub,11-02-2012 22:01,-1,-1,0,t3_pl0ko,t1_c3q8vpw,,,0,0

* What's your opinion of other ""green"" technology cars such as the Leaf. Many of the Asian automakers seem to be already ahead of the curve and continually improving their offerings.

* Is it not true that Tesla automobiles will be heavily subsidized? I believe I read something a while ago that said if the Republicans win in 2012, they may remove all alternative energy subsidies which Tesla is dependent on. In any case, should the economy stall or dip, what is your assessment on the risk to these subsidies?

* You mentioned Tesla also supplies the Powertrain for many other green vehicles as a profit driver. Are there any other competitors in this market? What is the risk that the other car companies will abandon using Tesla's powertrain and use another supplier's or develop their own?",bgritzut,InvestmentClub,12-02-2012 14:25,1,1,0,t3_pl0ko,t3_pl0ko,,,0,0
c3qgj2f,"hmm

to answer your first question i pretty much agree with this article

http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/110193-look-out-nissan-leaf-tesla-s-will-sell-for-under-50000-run-for-160-miles

the leaf has much less range than 160 mile tesla but costs less. The leaf only gets 100 miles per charge. and costs 27,000 which might be good for some city drivers or people who don't travel much.

Second question:

I did not here about this, I doubt the subsidies would be taken away from Tesla which is about $7,000 discount consumers get for buying a green vehicle. I recently posted a thread in r/politics about if the Republicans could win the presidency. reddit's reaction was a unanimous no due to the poor quality of this year's GOP candidates. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pd29u/will_it_be_a_disaster_for_the_republican_party_if/

Third question:

The risk is minimal, for the moment. All the manufacturers are set to start releasing there EV's this year and next year and it's too late to make a major change such as the power-train at this point in the game. Auto makers would have to wait for the next generation of their EV's to move away from Tesla's power-train which would be a costly and risky move for most companies. Tesla is at least safe for now on this issue, but i believe Tesla will continue to innovate and create new designs and better power-trains that other companies will want to buy/use later.",ajsmithjr,InvestmentClub,12-02-2012 17:09,2,2,0,t3_pl0ko,t1_c3qfeuk,,,0,0

I could go point by point to refute the 5 arguments you listed above - but the numbers speak for themselves.

Have you even read their 10K and 10Q filings???  Among the gems: ""Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately $418 million of cash in operations through September 30, 2011""  

""We anticipate that we will experience a significant increase in losses and will experience a significant decrease in revenues prior to the launch of the Model S. ""

""Our second planned vehicle, our Model S, is not expected to be in production until mid-2012, requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction, and may never be successfully developed or commercially successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design future models of performance electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the Model S, will become commercially viable. To the extent that we are not able to build the production Model S to the expectations created by the early prototypes and our anticipated specifications, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us""

""Our production model for the non-powertrain portion of the Model S is unproven, still evolving and is very different from the non-powertrain portion of the production model for the Tesla Roadster.""

They've already drawn down half of a gigantic 500M loan from the DOE...and their capital expenditures have not even hit the books yet.  And for anyone who has dealt with DOE grants before - it is an administrative nightmare.

c3rmqc6,"$829 is the price point for the most expensive iPad. Currently, the entry level is $499. Still, it's well above Amazon's loss leading $199, but this is the first year Apple has had any real competition in tablets. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple got a little more aggressive with pricing this year, perhaps continuing to sell the iPad 2 for $399.

The holiday quarter's iPad numbers (over 15 mil, 100%+ yoy growth) came after Kindle Fire's well publicized launch. I think people prefer iPads, and while some may settle for a competitor, most won't, including all the enterprises already using iPads. Plus, once people have an iPad at work, they're not buying a Samsung for home use. I think this was one of the main reasons that Microsoft dominated the computer industry.

They also have at least a 2 year head start. This is true for manufacturing costs, features in the pipeline, public perspective and brand recognition, and accessories and 3rd party software support.

From the 10Q Aug '11:


Distribution Policy

We intend to focus on making capital gains-based investments. As such, we do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on a quarterly basis or become a predictable issuer of dividends, and we expect that our dividends, if any, will be much less consistent than other business development companies that primarily make debt investments. However, to the extent there are earnings or realized capital gains to be distributed, we intend to declare and pay a dividend at least annually. 

We intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our 2011 taxable year. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses.

FYI: It wasn't a bunch of customers, just one disgruntled customer that was angry with Tesla and wanted to get his battery replaced. [Here's a link to an article that talks about the guy.](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1073312_is-tesla-bricking-story-just-an-angry-owners-shakedown?fbfanpage)

FWIW I don't think Tesla was in the wrong in not reimbursing the guy for the ""bricked"" battery. When purchasing a Tesla vehicle they make it very clear that you are not to leave the vehicle completely uncharged for an extended period of time. It's also in the owners manual and they spell it out clearly as one of three conditions that will void the battery warranty.

I do think that Tesla should be more proactive in alerting customers that are in danger of damaging their battery. From what I've read all new Tesla models are monitored and the owners will be notified if their vehicle reaches a critically low charge. I think Tesla is putting a little too much faith in their customers and at least an email or call will show that they at least tried to help out their customers. 

From the perspective of a share holder I just don't want them to get negative PR because people think they make poor vehicles.",[deleted],InvestmentClub,23-02-2012 08:12,4,4,0,t3_q1hxb,t3_q1hxb,,,0,0

Well if you have a gasoline engine car  you may have to get a jump. If you're driving this car you may have to shell out $40K. What happens when these starting showing up on used car lots for long periods of time? What happens when you have to drive 50 miles to the airport and then go on a month long trip? For most people this will never be an issue but for the few that have the problem it's pretty much losing 1/2 the value of the car.

I love the car and I love the idea of electric cars but it sounds like Tesla needs to address this issue. Nissan has already said that the Leafs battery pack will never discharge completely.

Can we maybe have a timeframe for submitting a stock pick + commentary. So for example, if we're going to pick a stock at the end of March, can we have like one week where we're posting these potential picks and then voting on them in that week? 

My concern is that I know for me, I've read many of these commentaries which is some cases are two plus weeks old now. We have missed the boat on some of these by this point. Especially when earnings may be coming out in the future like in April.

Another just random suggestion I have is to develop a standardized system for posting information about stocks to make the subreddit easier to read. My suggestion is to start posts as something like:

[TSLA] for a stock we own.

(AAPL) for a stock we are considering purchasing.

~DE~ for a stock that someone wants to talk about, but isn't on the table at the moment.

If posts based on those stocks were formatted like that, it'd make reading the subreddit easier in my opinion. It'd also mean that any thread that is just like ""(AAPL)"" we'd know is a purchase recommendation.

c3va35w,"Yes, something like that. The only reason I recommended the different bracketing is that the posts are all over the place using the ticker symbol and where. Really every thread that is a recommendation should start with [buy]DE or [DE] at the beginning so that someone who's coming into the subreddit knows exactly what each topic is discussing. Basically just developing a standardized title for each recommendation thread would be helpful. I think http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/ is a good example of how this makes everything easier to quickly find.

As far as the timeframe, my recommendation is actually to compress it a bit. So for example, if we're going to buy stocks on 1st of each month, recommendations and voting should be made in the week leading up to that. 

I am actually OK with posting recommendations further out because this is supposed to be longer term investment. But, perhaps we should just move to each recommendation thread has a comment by the OP with the stock ticker and link to discussion thread and the up/down vote is there. Similar to how it is on the sidebar. It'd just make voting a bit easier IMO. 

EDIT: Something like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/gdfno/best_episode_of_sttng_vote/ but with comments

Just my 2 cents though, so far so good with everything, I just like streamlining the process, and it might encourage some better debate if there's a master voting thread so we can say ""Well I like AAPL, but not at 520 so I'll go with BAC this month."" Just encouraging the discussion and all.

c3woe7k,"Origin is, currently, regarded as a plague by gamers. However, it may have real business value in the future, I agree. For now, they need to focus on their main competition: Steam. EA may have a lot of bang up titles coming their way, but lets not forget that they have an amazing amount of bloat from ""family entertainment"" software and licensed games. To be fair, a lot of companies have had this bloat, and most are making an effort to rid themselves of the dead weight.

As for ME3, it is supposedly the ""final"" in the Mass Effect saga. Even if it is the greatest selling game of all time, EA will need to fine new and innovative games to continue to interest gamers. 

Overall, I am neutral to very slightly bullish on EA for the short term (~ 1 year).

I think there are better opportunities for a big portfolio in the gaming industry. Take Two is rock solid. They own Rockstar studios, and produce big hit games like BioShock, Elder Scrolls (publisher). In addition, they are cutting kids and family entertainment bloat. I'd expect their stock to do very well over the next few years. 

Also, may be worth looking at THQI. The stock is depressed right now, but bloat was axed, and despite poor financials from 2008 onwards, lineup is improving and they have some solid titles that might do well. Also, they have the Relic engine, which I believe is very under utilized in the industry, and with proper application (either a better Warhammer lineup, or better yet, a COH 2  game) could be a blockbuster. Finally, the may be ideal for a buyout for another company in the near future if things don't go their way. They have exclusive licenses for WWE and UFC, the latter of which only seems to be gaining in popularity, lots of intellectual property which is valuable, and loads of industry experience which other companies might be interested in.

c3wthxn,"As of this moment I think NSC is undervalued.  Their basic service is to carry goods from point A to B.  What determines their revenue is maximizing carries and minimizing costs to to get the largest profit margin.  

In that case you have to take a look at what they carry.  Coal makes up a big percentage of their business and has been down recently.  However the other parts of their business such as auto's have been up.  Which means that if coal rises, and the other parts rise while they are minimizing costs they should make a rather large profit margin which will affect their net income which is their earnings.

One of the reasons I like them is because their debt load is spread over 100 years (they took advantage of the low interest rate environment).  Their cash flow is increasing ..albiet slowly, but they are a steady business that operates the majority of the East Coast shipping.  

Analysts expect the price range to be in the 88$ (now it's 70ish).  

However as a value investor you rarely look at price.  So, if you look at their P/E, take a look at their cash, analyze they last couple of annual reports.  In addition look at ROA/ROE, quick ration, current ration, LT Liabilities and finally check their expenses and it turns out to be quite an attractive buy in the global economy.

Perhaps you can suggest some other things to look at as well?

Im not sure why you think this company will perform well. Blizzard has had major sellers (WoW, Starcraft, and Diablo) but their stock hasnt reflected the success of these games. I do not think it will happen with EA either. 

Looking at the EA balance sheet, they haven't made a profit in over 5 years. Since 2009, their revenue has been in decline as well. While the games may be successful, I do not think that this is a good investment.

I may be wrong, but are there any other reasons why you're bullish on this company? I would not rush into buying this stock. ",Learninginmotion,InvestmentClub,04-03-2012 07:20,2,2,0,t3_qcift,t3_qcift,,,0,0

c3yagj6,"I'm speaking purely as a gamer here (and an investor to a lesser extent). I've played WoW since it's inception back in 2004. The reason Activision-Blizzard isn't as successful anymore is due to the fact that the WoW franchise is turning 8 years old at the end of this year. The game has seen improvements with expansions, but overall turn-around on subscriptions seems to be at an all-time high with many users moving on to play other MMOs like SW:TOR or a different game genre like the increasingly popular League of Legends, which is free to play. I also predict that more games will move to the free-to-play, pay-to-progress model after seeing how well such a model worked for Riot Games. I also wanted to mention that the Blizzard end of Activision moves very slow with game releases, which generally irritates their customer base. Their releases have slowed even more in recent years and rely on the aging franchises that gamers are beginning to get tired of.

c44qa5f,"In my opinion, this is a very poor quality company that should not be considered. 

**1. The ""Marijuana hype"" is already priced into the stock:**

The company has had ~ 74k in revenues YTD (almost all of which was one time, license revenues), on a run rate basis lets say that's 100k for the year. At the same time the company trades at a $21,000,000 valuation, which if you use this run-rate revenue number (which is very generous given their low recurring revenues) is a staggering valuation of 210x revenue. To put things into context, Salesforce.com trades at 10x revenue?

**2. In terms of financial health, this company is on the ropes and will continue to screw over its equity holders or choose to go bankrupt:**

They have around $1,200 in cash as of last quarter (again, this is not a typo, or wrong units), but they have total liabilities of $1,400,000, and are generating negative cash per quarter. Effectively they have been able to finance themselves only by issuing shares, which screw over equity holders through dilution (and at these valuations, why not sell your shares?). Its either that, or go bankrupt. Their accumulated equity deficit is around $68m.

**3. The head of the company has no experience with medical marijuana technology, and is solely a politician who wants to get marijuana legalized. He has no incentive to make this company work**

It appears to me that Steve Kubby is using this company as a vehicle to profit from his efforts to get marijuana legalized. If you read the 10-K, it was first an oil and gas company, that was converted into ""Cannabis Sciences."" This company was thrown together and from a high level overview, I feel there is no credible reason that they will generate attractive returns to shareholders.

My entire thesis hinges that no one saw this high of sales and dlc coming that investors, analysts and EA have not factored in these earnings. BF3 and sports were known entities that don't appear to have reacted in any unpredicted way.

You are right though, they have done quite a good job holding onto the sports franchises. Thats pretty steady income for them. None the less I don't see EA right now as a long term play. Honestly I am hesitant about ANY media company as a long term play because they are so ephemeral. That said, if I was betting long term I would go with ATVI.

At this point, I think buying EA was a mistake. I've come to the same conclusion that you have, they're not a long term play. For all the reasons you've listed, I'm going to hang on to them, but I don't think they have solid financials and they just seem like a really rocky company. Hopefully their earning statement for Q2 will be impressive, but I feel like I'm banking that all on Star Wars.

I like their solid lineup which is made of money making titles, and I know they also license EA Sports bars, which is pretty cool. They just seem like a company that has spread itself out really thin, and if they suffer one or two major blows, it'll knock the price down.

ATVI just seems more stable in the long term, and I don't hate them. So it would be nice to invest in them just so I have a staple video game company in my portfolio.

c491c7y,"1.  Marijuana Hype?  Get real - more people favor the legalization of Marijuana in the U.S. than those who do not.  It's a matter of time.  And when the time comes you'll be kicking yourself in the ass that you didn't invest in a company like this.  

2.  Fair.  However, most penny stocks do this - they have to do this from going under until they generate legit revenue streams.  Also, they're creating products which cost money - give it time.

3.  This is where I realized you have no idea what you're talking about.  Steve Kubby is NOT CEO - he was fired in 2010.  CBIS' CEO is Dr. Robert Melamede - who SPECIALIZES in Marijuana growth, cultivation, research, and any other thing you could possibly dream up that is associated with the plant.  He has a PHD, and is a Biology professor at the University of Colorado (Colorado being one of the most lenient states as far as MJ is concerned - therefore his research is anything but interfered with).  You think there is not a credible way this company can generate revenue?  They're making topographical ointments/solutions that DESTROY  skin cancer.  Yesterday they just confirmed that a patient of theirs is now CANCER FREE after using their ointments on an area affected by Squamous cell carcinoma.  They confirmed through their patient's doctor who conducted a biopsy.  

The only reason this company would go under is because the government is trying to hide the fact that Marijuana is a healing plant.

A hedge is an investment that reduces risk of price volatility in your overall portfolio. So typically you short an asset that trades in high correlation to one you already are invested in, but you believe it will under perform your current investment. 

Why this is a hedge is because Spanish and US equities typically trade with high correlation, but due to the circumstances in Spain currently Spanish equities have been vastly under performing. So if U.S. equities were to take a sharp decline, a short position in Spanish equities would turn a profit. 

So having our current portfolio being exclusively invested in long U.S. equities I felt it would be appropriate to short an under performing foreign market that trades in relative correlation with the US.",[deleted],InvestmentClub,27-04-2012 19:09,2,2,0,t3_rnioi,t1_c4havsb,,,0,0

One warrant enables a shareholder to buy a KMI common stock at $40

I ran an [analysis]( http://imgur.com/MMmRo) of KMI’s stock price since 2/11/2011 and its trend with an R-squared of .86.  The stock’s price projected May 23rd is $46.08.  Running the fits against the actuals I found an average deviation of $1.56 with a maximum deviation of $7.24.  For the remainder of this analysis I am using an expected KMI stock price of $38.84.

Assuming we bought 100 shares of EP at today’s price of $29.17 the acquisition would [yield]( http://imgur.com/SQ9Hr) 21.80% for option A, -13.70% for option B, and 3.464% for option C.  We will see benefits if KMI stock climbs and EP stock falls.  Unfortunately, that’s not the case, it looks as if they are both on a general increase.  Running a [similar analysis]( http://imgur.com/GLjbq) for EP we can get the equation of the stocks trend.  

Through calculus we can get the rate of accelerating for each stock price.   Our analysis shows us that KMI is decreasing at a slower rate than EP, which means our options will become less and less profitable as time goes on.  I’ve estimated a worst case scenario EP stock price of $32.84, which we will still yield 8.19% on [option A]( http://imgur.com/r9Xb8). 

KMI showed a loss in 2010  of 41.3 million, primarily from losses from equity investments.  With all of their subsidiaries combined, KMI posted [profits]( http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1506307/000113501712000009/kmi10k2011.htm#item8) of 769 million in 2011, 426 million in 2010, and 609 million in 2009.  Their cash flows have been increasing substantially, and they are moderately leveraged (will change to a heavier leverage when they acquire EP). 

This merger has been approved by the board of directors and is awaiting regulation approvals, stockholder approvals, and the issuance of KMI proposals (mentioned above).  KMI planes to sell EPs exploration and production assets for approximately 7.15 billion dollars, reducing EPs assets to approximately 17 billion.

c4jbyod,"I bought EA a few weeks ago and I agree with most of your analysis. The sector has been doing poorly recently because of the decline of retail stores and the belief that there is a trend towards mobile gaming, which is a load of shit, in my opinion. Saying that mobile gaming is taking over console/PC gaming is like saying that crossword puzzles cause people to play less football. The audience is different. I also agree that EA stands to benefit from GameStop's downfall with digital downloads and that the ""Worst Company"" label doesn't mean anything. There is a lot of talk about the Mass Effect 3 ending (which did suck, admittedly). I think this was intentional and a smart move on EA's part. Had the game ended properly, most people would have stopped playing. Since we are all anxiously awaiting the summer DLC, EA can monetize this continued interest with paid DLC packs and revenue coming in from multiplayer points. In addition to all of this, I think EA has a good strategy to combat piracy. Someone I know pirates every PC game, but he could not resist the incentive for early demo access to buy both BF3 and ME3. ME3 multiplayer is very fun and it was enough for a lot of people to buy the game rather than pirate it.

That said, I do have some concerns going into the earnings report. EA invested a lot into SWTOR and I can't imagine it's been as successful as they hoped. As an occasional WoW player, I don't think a Star Wars MMORPG was a good idea. It excludes too many people who weren't huge Star Wars fans. The purpose of an MMORPG should be to tell an epic interactive story. I wasn't a very big SW fan, but I get the gist of it already and I think it would be boring to play for that reason. I'm not sure how much this will impact earnings. 

The Nexon rumor was bizarre to me. I'm still an amateur investor, but who was taking that seriously? Either way, when the speculation heats up later in the year about next-gen consoles, I'm confident that this stock will be up significantly.

While this MAY be a temporary slump and go away I don't personally like EA's prospect for the next year and don't like videogame/media stocks in general over that time. (Tehe, I made a joke.) If I were to invest in that sector for a significant time period (years) I would invest in ATVI or THQ. ATVI's stock is pretty range bound and just doesn't appreciate so I'd be holding it for the dividend and hopes eventually there would be a day with large volatility to the upside that I could sell the stock for a significant profit. Not improbable looking at its history and in fact I've made that play before. THQ has the most growth potential because it basically broke as a company and had to cut down to the barebones. I believe it will turn around but that could take a very long time and I would not bet a large part of my portfolio on a stock so dependent merely hopes and dreams. In truth I have no idea if ANY of the games THQ has announced for 2012 and 2013 will sell well enough to pull them out of their slump let alone whether the games will be good. And they better be good if they want to sell since none of them are games like COD or Warcraft that are guaranteed money makers.

Beta: 3.6 to 0.5

Dividend Yield: 0 to 3%

D/E: 0.5 to 0.9

c4upwyq,"I'm honestly not playing it from a pure valuation perspective.  But if you wanted to do so, you need to look at it from a value tilt, we should be looking at P/Tang BV and free cash flow generation (which is positive and growing).  Forward FCF yield is 10-11%, P/TBV is running at .76.  A P/E metric should only be considered if you think this is a growth stock (this is a very generalized statement but I don't have time to go into it).   If you take a look at cash flows, you also see that mgmt is very diligent in paying down their revolver with any available cash, so D/E isn't too much of an issue.  Beta is useless unless you think CAPM holds, which it doesn't.  Divid yield can be important, but mgmt has authorized $50m in share buybacks (10+% of capitalization), so that's where you can get comfort in that.  

RT is not a growth company, but the acquisition of Lime Fresh (double digit comp sales) gives it an outlet to run.  That being said, my main argument is very limited downside.  If three was an easy way to post excel models/powerpoint pitches, let me know.

One thing I have trouble with is your assumption that sale-leasebacks are a great thing. While I agree they can free up a lot of money in the short-term, its just moving liabilities off the balance sheet. RT will still owe the money down the road, and their I/S will look slightly better since they won't have to report depreciation/interest expense on the capital leases anymore.

c4wda9t,"I get that question a lot, hopefully this will answer it.

It's not exactly clear if its liabilities off the balance sheet. RT uses a mix of capital/operating which they don't disclose, but assuming thats the issue, isn't that a good thing given RT's current situation?  If the debt related to capital leases is at around 300-400 million, but we can monetize for 700m+, theres obviously a couple hundred million that's not getting factored in.  Looking at the healthy market available (see pf changs, burger king/carrolls, and one other acquisition I can't remember as of all in the last month), I think this should def be included.  Also, my model accounts for incremental operating lease payments based off current cap rates going fwd, so my adj ev/ebitda is accounting for operating expenses.

I was being a bit simplistic in my statement about P/E, but in this case, where I'm arguing a value stock with less that rosy future prospects, P/E is a useless figure.  Furthermore, it just devolves into the whole ""what is a multiple?"" argument.  I think looking at free cash flow and downside risk is really important due to their negative comp history.  As a holder of the company, even if this company goes down, what would I be getting back?  Furthermore, since they are in this near zero earnings phase, we're going to get inflated P/E levels that are hard to use as comps.  I like to look at P/E when i'm doing a revenue build for a growth company, because I'm not so much worried about going concern or cash flow as I am about profitable growth.  Hope that explained it.  If you want the model PM me and I'll send it over in pdf =&gt; I wouldn't mind letting you tinker around with it but I'm not 100% who owns it (I created it, turned it in for a school project, and also gave it to my work, will probably have to clear it with them just in case)",inefficientmarkets,InvestmentClub,05-06-2012 02:05,1,1,0,t3_udiql,t1_c4watx3,,,0,0

Maybe Ebay will cling to it and hold it back as excess weight. 

I normally try to be pretty safe unless I'm damn certain of future growth. If I see 40% gains, I'm pretty ready to sell and be pleased with my earnings, though you need to decide what kind of investor you are and basically what you're happy with. If I plan to be doing fairly active trading, like in the tech industry, I usually set a target, say I want the stock up 2 points, and when I hit it, I sell. I've made my money, and I'm out. Nothing that comes after that hurts me, but you've gotta do what you've gotta do. 

I'd be worried that EBay is rapidly fading to a dying Siamese twin next to PayPal though, just my .02.",Commodore_Tea_Leaf,InvestmentClub,24-07-2012 02:48,2,2,0,t3_x0q8w,t3_x0q8w,,,0,0

When I personally invest, I look for a 3 point rise, and then it would take a lot (solid dividends, really great reason to think that it will rise further to a different set goal) to make me hold it any longer. That's when I usually sell any stock, 3 points above my purchase. But I'm safe kind of guy, once I see a reasonable profit, I take it and hunt for my next one. If we bought, dividing the portfolio evenly with now 5 stocks, held until a 3 point rise (woud've been better to buy right away but this is still very reasonable to expect in the future), then sold, we'd make a $400,000 profit before trading costs and taxes, which isn't a bad deal at all. 

I would hold up until it makes that 3 point rise, because this is a solid company and it is secure for the future, but I repeat, I would wait to see it rise but 3 points from purchase price, and then I would sell all or most (depending of course on the will of the club).",Commodore_Tea_Leaf,InvestmentClub,07-08-2012 00:09,0,0,0,t3_x422q,t1_c5p46x8,,,0,0

It's not going anywhere - it's the largest mobile provider in France holding almost 40% market share. FTE going out of business in France would be akin to AT&amp;T or Verizon going out of business in the US; no matter how bad the economy gets, I don't see them disappearing. This year is their absolute worst in terms of OCF, due to Iliad entering the market, that's why OCF is down from €14 billion to €8 billion, but the dividend has already been cut to reflect this. Even after the cut, the dividend yields 11%, and was previously yielding a whopping 17%. They stated that they will keep dividends between 40-45% of OCF, and, with expected OCF CAGR of 9%, the dividend yield will be HUGE if the stock price doesn't rise. Stock is so cheap in so many ways. Of course I wrote up the analysis when the stock was trading at $12.90 (currently around ~$14.00), so it's currently at a bit more expensive of an entry point, but I still believe the stock to be undervalued. I might wait for a better entry, around $13.50 or so, but, in the long-term, it would be a negligible difference, should the expansion numbers hold true and the stock rises to ~$24.50.",benyBC,InvestmentClub,17-08-2012 12:40,0,0,0,t3_y11gk,t1_c5t2ba6,,,0,0

-I'm gonna look into this at work tomorrow, but even though there's a US-France tax treaty agreeing to a 15% withholding rate, I still think you get hit with a 30% withholding trading the ADR on a US exchange. If you're stuck with the 30% dividend rate, does this affect your analysis at all? 

-What's the story with Iliad? Looks like it's been around since '99 but from what I read it's more of an up-and-comer in the industry. You touch on this a bit in your analysis, but do you think it will pose a long-term threat to the big dogs in the French telecom industry?

If you're stuck with the 30% dividend rate, does this affect your analysis at all? 

It does affect it by a small amount, but I'm basically certain that you get the 15% tax rate, so long as you either manually fill out the IRS forms for the tax treaty, or have a broker that automatically does it for you (I know TD does this)

It sounds like for the time being Iliad has a fundamentally different strategy in pursuing lower-end subscribers, but do they have plans to expand beyond that and really go after FTE and the others? 

Iliad has been around a long time, but its primary business has always been internet. Only in January of 2012 did Iliad expand into the mobile services business with *Iliad Free*: a low-cost, sim-only plan. I do not believe Iliad will be a long term threat for several reasons:

- Various reports by major consulting/finance firms, such as Booz, E&amp;Y, and Morningstar, predict that the market for low-cost mobile subscribers to shrink to higher-cost, more tech-advanced smartphones. (see page 3 of [this](http://aiti.mit.edu/media/programs/colombia-summer-2012/materials/booz&amp;co_gsma-2012_futurecmt.pdf) report).

- It doesn't have the infrastructure currently in place to garner significant market share. It has a contract w/ FTE where FTE provides coverage for Ilian subscribers where there are no Iliad towers in exchange for very high roaming fees. This is a very lucrative contract for FTE.

- Market saturation already exceeds 100% in France, and, past studies have shown, at those levels of market saturation, when a new entrant enters the market, most of their customer base will come from converting fixed-line customers, but it is extremely difficult to steal significant market-share from pre-existing companies. Case studies of similar ventures in Japan, Germany, and other markets have all been met with failure.",benyBC,InvestmentClub,21-08-2012 01:53,2,2,0,t3_y11gk,t1_c5vtnbg,,,0,0

apple has a P/E of around 16 right now and i think 2 things

1. apple has enough company wide talent to survive without the legendary steve jobs and do him proud in the future
2. apple has room to run especially with this mystical apple TV we keep hearing about that could really help revolutionize one of our last, and currently outdated industries-TV subscription.

problem is 700/share is a lot of dough but you should get in while the getting is good because it will only get higher from here, plus there could be incoming dividends from this stock

c6gq9pg,"&gt; If there is news about an investment, that means all the truly smart people have already picked up on it.

But that doesn't mean that it isn't a good idea, or that everyone acted on it, or that it'll go much higher 5 years from now. 

The only other way to 'do my own research' would be to look at each company and spend hours going through data points to find little bits of information that i could potentially capitalize on. Since I don't have enough invested to do this full time, and I have a full time job that currently pays more than the ROI from my investment portfolio, I think it's much better to outsource this task to other sites, like Motley fool. For example, I paid $200 for one of their newsletters, and so far I've made about $2500 in returns on my investments. Not a bad ROI if you ask me, and much less expensive than spending hours every day looking for things that no one else in the entire world has noticed.",theorymeltfool,InvestmentClub,02-10-2012 23:48,3,3,0,t3_10gtln,t1_c6gq0n0,,,0,0

The problem is sites like that are very much a gamble and are usually selling something (like premiums on motley fool) or invested in something personally than write an article justifying it (seeking alpha for the most part, they are at least a little better than Motley Fool in general however.). Some of them are ok but for the most part identifying stocks in sectors you understand and think have potential, analyzing these companies products for competitive advantages and growth and than analyzing their financials for stability, growth, potentially dividends will help you pick stocks that are at least solid and than you can reading quarterly and annual reports and general news on the stock to keep up to date.

c70941d,"This is a value trap.  I analyzed Xerox last year after hearing a suggestion from Tony Scaramucci.  He bought I believe, but my research showed it to be crap.

The copy business is going down because paper use is declining.  This is fine on the surface, because Xerox wants to go into the maintenance business instead of the selling-copy-machines business, but more businesses are looking at alternative solutions (e.g., sharing a used machine rather than buying a dedicated new machine).

With respect to the EZ pass system they maintain: it's tech.  The problem is that the author here does not understand that Xerox's competitors aren't Dell or HP per se, but other manufacturers of copiers: Canon, for instance.  The problem with the R&amp;D in this type of business is that tech improves by leaps, meaning if Xerox has the best tech today, someone else will have the best tech next year (and hence win all the contracts).  Then, someone else still will have even better tech five years from now.  This is part of why the future cash flows are discounted so heavily in the stock.

It's not an overly complex business model and there isn't much to differentiate the three major players in that regard.

On the other hand, SBAC just made two huge acquisitions this year of over 5,000 towers from companies with lower tenant/tower ratios. With cell companies announcing investment plans in infrastructure, part of that will be to increase cell coverage. I'm sure they will be throwing quite a bit of business at AMT and CCI, but if they're looking to expand coverage they'll be going to the company with towers that they don't have antennas on yet.

I'm a retail trader for independent RIA's, Smaller B/D's and a few CU's, and I was previously a Flow trader on a decent-sized national desk.  If you're going to be buying bonds via an online broker, make sure you have the ability to see and trade with the street. If you can afford it TWR or KBP are decent retail platforms, but I'm not sure of the API for other custodians. Do you have a bloomberg terminal? Is there a reason you don't just open an account with your firm and simply trade Dealer to Dealer? Maybe as an analyst compliance would want an account held away, and just receive dup. confirms. I'm not compliance so cant tell you. I see alot of recomendations on here for IB so maybe they're worth looking at.  I will say this however, commish rates mean absolutely JACK when it comes to bonds. (of course all costs related in a securities transaction are to be considered, commish on bonds can be misleading) In fact, I'd rather have a broker charge me 10.00 per bond and trade for me in an ""Agency"" transaction, than to tell me they are charging me .50 cents per bond in a ""Principal Trade"" while the trade desk marks up/down 2 points!!  The amount of money you save upfront is astounding.  You're an analyst so you've probably heard this industry addage: Remember, there are no bad bonds, just bad prices.  You can buy a great bond at a horrible px and its a bad trade.  You can buy Default Junk at 10 cents and it be a home run. Most people on these threads don't see competitive offers so you won't hear this angle too much. So even if you've got great analytics/insight to an undervalued security if you don't have the ability to execute the transaction at a favorable level, the trade won't work. I guess I should have asked you in what capacity you were a fixed income analyst. Buyside fund/mm, Bank, Insurance, Research ? etc...Some of the aforementioned might not apply.

c7adrfq,"20% yearly growth?  Heh, let's try it again with more realistic math.

Say I want to buy a house / flat by the time I'm 30, and so saving for that from the age of 18. At 7% return:

( (1.07)^12 + (1.07)^11 + (1.07)^10  + (1.07)^9  + (1.07)^8  + (1.07)^7 + (1.07)^6 + (1.07)^5 + (1.07)^4 + (1.07)^3 + (1.07)^2 + (1.07))

 = 20

(Not sure how to simplify that math sorry)

So, if you make 12 yearly savings, the money saved is equal to 20 yearly savings.  So if you saved $1000 per year for 12 years, you'd have $20000.

More realistically though, inflation will eat into that.  Let's assume 3% inflation:

( (1.04)^12 + (1.04)^11 + (1.04)^10  + (1.04)^9  + (1.04)^8  + (1.04)^7 + (1.04)^6 + (1.04)^5 + (1.04)^4 + (1.04)^3 + (1.04)^2 + (1.04))

 = 15.6

So saving a total of $12,000 over 12 years, $1000 per year, would actually give you $15,600, inflation adjusted.

So frankly..   it's not really worth saving imho **if** you can use the money for better things.  And that was with a fairly risky 7% return.  You could just as easily lose a lot of that money too.

At a young age, you're better off investing the money into yourself.  Get a good education.

However if you'd just waste the money, then obviously save it instead.  But that's just normal saving, not because of compounding.

On a personal note, I spent all my money on education.  I got two degrees and a PhD, and paid for a PhD for my wife.  It has paid off big time - I finished paying off my student loans last week, and bought a flat a year ago, by the age of 30.

I'm going long on Google with the anticipation to get something out of when they publicly launch Google Glass. At this moment, I'm undecided whether Glass will be beneficial or not.

I've got a feeling (at the moment) that it won't benefit GOOG that much as they're planning to launch it with AT&amp;T in the US and AT&amp;T are planning on charging a huge amount for data tethering which will turn most people away from Glass. So, with that in mind, at the moment I would be looking to go long on GOOG and short it when it comes around to launch Google Glass.

If you have a program (such as thinkorswim), check out the macd indicator for longest term (see how it went from $6~to it's record low, and it has only been going up...and there's much room for it to go up). Aside from that, I looked into who the new CEO was since I posted the above comment. This guy can definitely run a company and make sure it profits. That announcement had a lot of unexpected plans to get cash flow going for the company (aside from simply providing electricity). 

A newer development (which is only in the talks as of now) is the idea of having a joint venture with a Chinese company, where electric vehicles compromise 25% of the market. At this moment, I was waiting and the long term wait for US drivers to make their slow attempts at switching over to all electric cars (or hybrids that provide electric charging as well), but if they start up in China, that stock will shoot up much sooner than expected (rather than a gradual incline up to several dollars per share). I bet it would get in the $10's/share, ESPECIALLY if that joint venture goes through. They really have something good to offer China, and China has smaller vehicles that don't require large batteries, just good charging stations and a well maintained service (ECOtality).

c97weoa,"Here's the problem with this: it has little to do with investing.  Here are my reasons:

1. If you set a time frame of anything less than 18 or 24 months, the winner has a high probability of winning based on variance in stock prices alone.  It could just be a lucky beta play and have nothing to do with any kind of investment analysis, for instance.

2. You offer a reward with no punishment in the event the portfolio takes on losses.  This means you're encouraging outright gambling: anyone can choose any stock with the hope of winning a real reward (prize) at the end.

3. You never tailor an investment pool to the community it serves.  You tailor it according to what is right and what is wrong.  If, for instance, everyone in the community invests in small caps and an investor in large cap stocks beats them all over time, then you need to be open to that; you need to see what's going on.  Investing is not a popularity contest.  By tailoring your pool to the community, you're tailoring it to what is most popular.

4. Investing should not and is not limited solely to publicly-traded equities.

5. Scale is a real issue and should be calculated.  What works for a million dollar portfolio does not necessarily work for a $100mm portfolio.

Ultimately, I believe a ""real"" estimate of abilities would come from a fund management simulation over the course of five years, with trades mtm at the end.  No leverage allowed.  Fees and tax liability calculated in the final portfolio value, including tax savings from strategic planning, and excluding assets where tax is not yet realized (with a note of what the value would be if taxes were realized at the time of calculation).  Trades need not be disclosed immediately, but can be disclosed at contest end, provided that the investor actually made the trade in real life and is willing to document buy date, sell date, and cost basis.

No one reads about proper investing techniques because no one reads.  If anyone did bother to read, they'd understand that a competition like this just makes everyone dumber.  Why?  Because if you put 1000 people in a room and have them flip a coin ten times, you'll probably have one guy who flips ten heads in a row.  Then you're going to ask him how he did it.  Then he's going to share with you his perceived ""secret technique,"" when, in fact, we're really only talking about variance.  This contest, as conceived in its current form, is no different.

c9ba0bw,"&gt;Bill Spetrino, Jr., BillSpetrino.com
Professional investor. Senior financial editor of The Dividend Machine.

*Editor’s note: With proper research and focus, instead of overwhelming confusions, value investing is much easier than many people make it to be.  Investing for a comfortable future is actually within everyone’s ability.  Bill Spetrino gives some great reminders in this article to keep us on that path.

Investing is not as hard as it seems. Just remember these 7 rules that, unfortunately, many of you violate.

1. Do NOT time markets. If you could, that means you can retire from your day job and show your tax returns to prospective investors to start a hedge fund.

2. Do NOT own more than 5 to 8 positions. I understand diversification, but you can’t realistically follow more than 8 stocks.  You will overwhelm yourself.  And honestly, there is a usually a huge difference between stock #1 and stock #8. The best thing I ever did was swap out my positions in Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNI) and Kraft (KFT) for Altria (MO). I switched several low dividend stocks for a high dividend stock and it really fired up my dividend machine big time.

3. Do NOT worry if your investment doesn’t run up right away. Warren Buffett has had 5 stocks that dropped big time when he started buying them: Washington Post, Interpublic, Wells Fargo on 2 occasions, Anheuser Busch, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

4. Sell something to buy in layers into something that drops drastically. I sold my Abbott Labs (ABT), Cisco (CSCO) and Altria (MO) options in 2011 to buy Bank of America (BAC) under $7 dollars. Bank of America was at $12.94 a couple of days ago. See how well that worked out?

5. Do NOT spend much time less than 95% invested. I have been doing this for 20 years now and I don’t remember any time where SOMETHING wasn’t cheap and priced to make 10%+ annually. Even though my Apple (AAPL) investment is underwater, I’m up for the year significantly because I’m invested and made good money on SVU, MSFT, INTC and MO options. Now, I am down on all the money i rolled into Apple so far, but with a large part of my portfolio in a very UNDERVALUED depressed stock, I have great potential going forward.

6. Be patient when your positions move against you. Remember, investing is all about irrational markets.  Many short term momentum players neglect great value stocks like Bank of America BAC when it was $5 or $6 because they just can’t take the pain of a falling stock price. If you can’t master this trait, you will never outperform the market.

7. Do NOT short stocks or bet against the direction of the market. The way to make money investing long term is to buy imagined fear layer down and wait for the market to recognize the value.

c9bjgre,"[Here is how it looks on my 15.6"" laptop screen.](http://i.imgur.com/hgRuLyz.png)
Here is far too much going on. You have a toolbar within the page at the top for us to like on facebook etc and yet you then have a massive left sidebar packed with ads and same/similar like and share buttons. 

Because of the left sidebar I had to zoom out in the page to actually read any of the article as the rest was cut off. You have a right sidebar which has ads in it, no problems with that but then you have a huge banner ad at the bottom. For me having a banner ad at the bottom is an issue because the top toolbars follow you when scrolling down the page. 

Summary - remove left sidebar and bottom banner ad and it'd look a lot simpler and more readable. 

Edit - If you really must have the like buttons down the left side, look for a less in your face feature such as a simple small box with a facebook logo / twitter logo that follows as you scroll.

c9u6i0p,"The standard advice is to have everything money related in your life running smooth 
before you start investing.  ie. emergency fund, IRA, 401k, all funded.

If you don't yet have an IRA you should use that to set up your investing account. 

Realistically, you'll want at least $500 spare cash to open an account. The discount brokers are about $5 per trade each way. 

I started my ""fun"" account with about 1k extra cash.

c9wsgbl,"At a glance, they are trading at a discount to cash-debt (-$41 million enterprise value), but burned through $34 million in Q1 2013 alone and have no significant revenues.  Their remaining cash is likely to be burned without a drug approval.

""tivozanib did not demonstrate a favorable benefit-to-risk evaluation
for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in an adequate and well controlled trial."" Drug was rejected 13 to 1.

I am not qualified to fully evaluate the likelyhood of a drug candidate reaching FDA approval, but this does not sound like something that has much of a chance of ever reaching approval, or at least not anytime soon (i.e. before they burn through their remaining cash addressing problems the FDA had and doing another secondary offering).
